Weak signals can be defined as the first indicator of a change or an emerging issue in the present that may become significant in the future. Investigating and discovering weak signals has been used in business settings to spot upcoming trends for investment. The Atlas of Weak Signals is a toolkit consisting of cards that recognise weak signals, random triggers and areas of opportunity into a practical space to navigate and understand possible emerging scenarios based on underlying trends in our current world. It facilitates seeking opportunities, threats, challenges and shared visions for innovation, policymaking, intervention, research and business opportunities in the future. The first exercise when using the AoWS toolkit was to randomly choose two weak signals, three random triggers and one area of opportunity and analyse what these mean, how they can be connected and what possible interventions could be. This what a great exercise to start understanding the methodology of how they can be used without directly choosing own areas of interest. Afterwards we looked through all the cards and chose one that was associated with our \u2018fight\u2019 posters and vision. Thereafter we walked around the city to take photos of interventions regarding the card we chose. I chose the card Regenerative Design as it is an overall concept of my vision and Fight poster. While walking around the city I passed through the SuperBlocks in Sant Antoni, one of the projects opening up spaces in the city where cars have been dominant. The projects Super Blocks address challenges such as mobility, public space, bio diversity and social cohesion, involving the participation of local residents and organisations. It is a low cost, small scale intervention that adds spaces of greenery for both humans and animals to coexist in urban environments. While continuing the journey through the city I walked passed a wall of graffiti paintings, where one of the art pieces cited \u2018Lo que era antes\u2019 - what has been - with a painting of a flower growing out of a tin can. What if what we produced could actually provide nurture to this flower growing, instead of overusing this flowers natural resources and spreading material that it can\u2019t use\u2026 PERSONAL DESIGN SPACE This toolkit is part of a method to help us communicate thoughts and concepts while supporting to detect a direction of our vision and areas of interest. When starting on my personal design space showing areas of interest and direction narrowing down the selection of cards to just a few was a challenge. I realised I have many interests, although when connecting them there is an overall theme. The Weak Signals chosen were Climate Conscience, Fight Anthropocene Conflicts, Inter-Species Collaboration and Human-Machine Creative Collaborations , where Regenerative Design was placed in the middle as a random trigger and binding theme. The random triggers around these Weak Signals can be divided into different sub categories. One evolves around working with material resources and production locally and reusability to design within planetary boundaries. This is prolonged into the area of collaborating with machines, questioning supply chains where open source innovation, personal fabrication and local production such as neighbourhood FabLabs could take part in the challenges of the first area. To extend these areas into practice the area of communicating and educating residents and users becomes one of the seeds and necessities for interventions in the other areas to start. How can we design within planetary boundaries on a local level? How can we create awareness and understanding of what citizens can do with the resources that are around them? I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks where we will be introduced to many different topics, as well as reflecting and engaging with topics in my neighbourhood and home that can be opportunities of interest. Some areas of interest that have arised while producing this Design Space are learning more about bio materials and synthetic biology, how it can be produced, used and reused. Using what already exists in nature to decrease waste and regenerate fuel for existing ecosystems. Other topics are about recycling waste and the recycling systems that exist in the area that I live, which I feel to be hard to understand and use. Many people I have spoken to in the neighbourhood are also unsure of the procedures and how it works. Can these be improved and communicated more clearly to decrease waste in the area? Another area of interest was sparked when taking photos of the Superblocks for this weeks assignment. The area in Sant Antoni where this block is, has created a space for people and other living things to co-exist with less cars, more plants and space. It is great for biodiversity to create these spaces, yet every night it is completely lit up by the street lights contributing to light pollution in urban environments. This disrupts ecosystems posing threat in particular to nocturnal wildlife, having negative impacts on plant and animal physiology. It can confuse the migratory patterns of animals, alter competitive interactions of animals and cause physiological harm. The rhythm of life is orchestrated by the natural diurnal patterns of light and dark; so disruption to these patterns impacts the ecological dynamics with just as big effect on humans, who are dependent on natural body cycles and the production of melatonin, which are regulated by light and dark. If humans are exposed to light while sleeping, melatonin production can be suppressed, which can lead to sleep disorders and other health problems such as fatigue, stress and increased anxiety among other things. This topic comes from a direct effect of my own sleep being disrupted from the overflow of artificial light. The subjects and signals in my Design Space are areas I want to learn more about. I am at the moment looking at these areas from a bigger perspective, being open to opportunities that are arising around me that can lead to an understanding of what areas to more specifically focus on.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"Josephine Bourghardt 16.10.22 During the second week of MDEF we were introduced to the Atlas of Weak Signals.

The prototype as an experimental component where prototyping tests a hypothesis. Through statistical analysis the prototypes test attributes such as: usability tests of the prototypes, experiential trials to assess the design attributes such as aesthetics, color, texture details, material properties or cases where the prototype is treated as a physical hypothesis. In product and furniture design rapid prototyping is a substantial part of the design process to test and understand form aesthetically and functionally, scale, construction and usability. Usually starting in a scale of 1:5 to quickly create and assess alternations in form and structure. Thereafter moving on to a rapid prototype in the scale of 1:1 to assess proportions aesthetically to the human body and space. It is a quick way to assess and test alternations that are thereafter tested in a functional 1:1 scale prototype testing ergonomics, usability and interaction, details and materials. The prototype as a means of inquiry where prototypes are developed and deployed as instruments of inquiry to collect, record and measure phenomena. Prototypes are in this case used as an open-ended exploration to find information where there is no hypothesis. It can be a qualitative and /or quantitive study that can be combined with other methods of finding information such as interviews. During projects this way of using prototypes can be a great way of understanding material properties by experimenting structural attributes, reformation and qualities. It is also a great way to understand how people behave or understand situations to learn new perspectives and understandings of a situation by using cultural or digital probes. The prototype as a research archetype as embodiments of concepts, understandings or design spaces that can be argued to constitute contributions to the discipline. The role the prototype plays in this contribution is usually exemplary and used to show different possibilities of how things could be. It illustrates or demonstrates possibilities as a physical embodiment of research concept,\u2019understanding or design research space. It is conceptual and methodological, where the result doesn\u2019t have to be a physical product, but can be a render, sketch or visualisation. The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry where the process of making an artefact becomes a qualitative instrumental tool in design research. The process is documented, analysed, critically assessed and written up, and the research contribution is tied not to the artefact itself but the process of prototyping and how it generates knowledge. It becomes a driver for the direction of research and can be seen in Co-Design and Participatory Design as well as Digital and Cultural Probes where people are brought into the design process. With this method of prototyping many different perspectives and understandings are brought into the process and become direction in where the project could be moving towards. The process becomes the important direction and by documenting and assessing the information that becomes visible along the way is can give more knowledge and insight than the actual result, if there is one. Throughout projects the different roles of prototyping provide information to help understand the situation and assess if it\u2019s moving in the right direction and solving the right problem. In many projects they intertwine and are used within different phases of the process to collect and assess information and I use most of them in most projects to find inspiration, understand context and users, as a means of experimenting and testing hypothesis. During this year I\u2019m looking to work more with prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry, to work participatory with communities and other fields of expertise. In the past this is the one means of prototyping I have worked the least with, but one that I see one of the most interesting to evolve in. Furthermore using prototyping as a research archetype to illustrate and visualise possibilities and ideas as a means to start discussions and reflections. DESIGN SPACE Below I have mapped what infrastructures and people are available for projects in a workspace. COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES The communication mediums chosen to communicate before, within and after interventions have been infographics, drawings and visualisations to make it easy to understand the topics presented, photographing, video journaling and workshops or gatherings to get input and output. The chosen communication strategies are: \u00b7 Sharing participants\u2019 observations, reflections and experiences during and after our interventions \u00b7 Leave a trace of your project/contact in physical space when it is closely related to a specific area or context \u00b7 Call for collaboration for partners or participants \u00b7 Striving for continuity, creating a community. \u00b7 Understand your audience \u00b7 Offering visibility to others (human or non-human), serve as a bridge, showcase the work of others \u2013 can serve as state of the art research process too \u00b7 Simple language for accessibility \u00b7 Being transparent about your intentions, offering a space where people you are trying to reach and connect can understand better your background, your values, your commitment, your motives, your positionality \u2013 creating a foundation for trust \u00b7 Take quality photos all the time even if you don\u2019t know what they will be for. \u00b7 Experiment with new formats \u00b7 Showing long term commitment \u00b7 Becoming open and transparent about your making/production processes and materials resourcing \u00b7 Compiling material samples and production samples (a catalog or object that can serve as a demo of your research) \u00b7 Creating demos, demonstrators, or experiential prototypes. For most of the interventions we have used communication strategies to understand our audience, where we have worked together with different target groups to get a better understanding of the subject. The process of choosing these stragegies has been fluid as the interventions and situations we have worked with have somewhat emerged fluidly in the process. We have recorded observations, reflections and experiences and created demos and prototypes for better understanding of the subject, together with a catalog of recipes and tips. We have been working together with communities where creating trust has been a big part of the collaboration and will continue to do so further on. Together we aim to make complex situations become more clear.","title":"DesignStudio"},{"location":"term1/03-DesignStudio/#design-studio","text":"THE ROLES OF PROTOTYPING There are different roles a prototype plays within a design process, but in principal the basis lies in quickly testing and quickly making mistakes at low costs to observe, record and analyse the output.

Biology can be seen as the study of life and can be studied very broadly focusing on the whole planet or in very specific studies of for example microscopic structures like bacteria or DNA. We got an introduction to microbiology, the study of microorganisms, a diverse group of generally minute simple life-forms that include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. The field is concerned with the structure, function, and classification of such organisms and with ways of both exploiting and controlling their activities. Thereafter we made our own DIY laboratory and created an All Purpose Medium with simple ingredients that can be found in the local supermarket to grow and analyse living matter. We went hunting for bacteria and chose to take samples from the bathroom door handle and different fingerprints. This was placed in the incubator to later observe and analyse if or what kind of bacteria grows. We learned the importance of labelling and sorting samples to know what is what and how it has been handled, taking notes on recipes, procedures, changes and time slots. We learned the procedure of using scientific methods to experiment to be able to communicate and analyse outcomes. We looked at different tissue and organs through microscopes to understand how different microscopes work. Learning about the possibilities of making your own DIY microscope. With other recipes in the DIY Lab we made different Bio Materials, again with simple ingredients that can be found in supermarkets. Our group worked with Glycerine, Maizena and Vinegar, resulting in a Bio \u2018Plastic\u2019 with slightly transparent property depending on the thickness chosen. With flexible characteristics the thinnest sample seems to suit this recipe the best. Thereafter we learned how to grow Combucha and Spirulina. In the Agri part we learned about bees and beekeeping and farm projects with the use of technology. Throughout the course we have been working with theory alongside practical work. Learning how to work with DIY Bioplastics, as well as growing Spirulina, was very inspiring and something I\u2019ll be working with more at home to investigate recipes and textures. I\u2019m also interested to learn more about the opensource beehives and how to communicate these projects. Analysis - Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops Published 29 September 2021 By Pallab Ghosh In the BBC article \u2018Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops you can read about how the UK discusses allowing gene edited fruits and vegetables to be commercially grown and available. Due to Brexit, the UK is no longer a part of the European Union and therefor neither the restrictions they have regarding gene modified or edited farming and produce. Many scientists believe that they can use gene editing to develop fruit, vegetables and cereals that are more nutritious and productive, as well as hardier varieties that can withstand the extremes of weather brought about by climate change, but this is restricted in many countries (Ghosh, 2021). As populations keep growing it is expected that food production will have to double in the next 50 years. Unintentional environmental factors effect crops where an average of 33% of all fruit and vegetables are wasted or lost to causes such as disease, drought, extremes of temperature, and other environmental stresses. Plant gene editing has a profound potential to create new crops with desirable characteristics that could improve agricultural production. Manipulation of plant genomes has been achieved with the gene-editing tool CRISPR\u2013Cas9. Mutations in the genomes can apply and activate valuable traits in many crop species, such as lifecycles, additional nutrition and growth. This may improve the overall efficiency of fruit and vegetable production so that costs may be lowered, thereby bringing fresh produce within the means of more populations and strengthening the industry as well as worldwide health (Shipman, et al, 2021) These possibilities of changing the traits of produce to increase nutrition and production can definitely help solve some of the issues from growing populations and environmental impacts in the future, but at what cost? The article continues with discussing the UK governments future thoughts of also reviewing regulations of all genetically modified organisms which includes allowing commercial development and farming of gene-edited and genetically modified animals. This can make them more productive, resistant to some diseases and better withstand weather conditions. Many scientists and others within the field are welcoming these changes, while there are groups that are sceptical to the ethical impacts it can have on production methods and safety of animals and other living organisms. In another BBC article - \u2018Rules to create gene-edited farm animals must put welfare first - review\u2019 a report by the Nuffield Council for Bioethics warns that removing the current ban on the commercial development of gene-edited animals could increase livestock suffering. As farming is a business there can be different understandings and thoughts from breeders of farm animals where to tread a line between what they can get out of it and animal welfare. If gene edited animals could better tolerate poor conditions without any apparent health impacts it causes tension between the producer and animal welfare. In an experiment carried out during the 1980s a human gene was added into the DNA of pigs expecting them to grow faster and become leaner. The experiment succeeded where the pigs weight gain increased, together with feed efficiency, and carcass fat reduced. In a commercial and productive point of view this experiment was successful, but beyond these effects the pigs also suffered from several unanticipated serious health problems and suffering. \u201cThose involved in policing must look beyond solely questions of food safety and keep in mind an overall vision of a food and farming system that supports sustainable farming and improves standards of animal welfare (Ghosh, 2021). Reading these articles about subjects that could soon become reality pose the questions of who and what will be next? Human genome editing has the potential to advance our ability to treat and cure disease with benefits including faster and more accurate diagnosis, more targeted treatments and prevention of genetic disorders. Somatic gene therapies, which involve modifying a patient\u2019s DNA to treat or cure a disease, have been successfully used to address HIV, sickle-cell disease and transthyretin amyloidosis. The technique could also vastly improve treatment for a variety of cancers (World Health Organisation, 2021). It could also be used to trans-generationally \u2018correct\u2019 or avoid single-gene disorders entirely, but like in other fields of genetics and genomics, such as newborn screening, reproductive genetics or return of results, it is not possible to globally agree on what is right and wrong as this can be influenced by various factors, such as commercial pressure, a technological imperative, ideological or political views, or personal values. As well as associated values often differing between different groups, different cultures and countries. As with any new experimental therapeutic, the unknowns still outweigh what is known and issues of risk assessment and safety, risk/benefit calculation, patient monitoring, reimbursement, equity in access to new therapies and the potential for the unjustified draining of resources from more pressing therapies, particular protection for vulnerable populations, and informed consent remain important to study further (Howard, et al. 2018). We live in an era of rapidly evolving technologies, where we previously, not a very long time ago, had more time to assess and adjust or correct impacts. As the world around keeps evolving in an even quicker pace, how can we assess how it is impacting the environment, what this is doing to our habits, the cultural sense of who we are, and even more have time to adjust or correct instabilities before the future impacts become unrepairable? From gene editing fruits and vegetables, to animals and then curing diseases in humans, what would be the next step? Is this therapy or enhancement? To be able to enhance traits that can benefit humans and the environment are great, but to what extent? Who would have access to these enhancements? And who decides this? The ethical questions about new technologies and methods are of great importance to discuss before taking action just because the possibilities are there. To assess what the actual impacts could be from different perspectives and within different systems is a crucial part of the process, one that in many situations has to be re introduced. These questions should be just a as important within all fields, one of them being design. Discussing and reflecting on what we are doing, why we are doing it and how it will impact the environment and living things around us, now and in the future. Sources Ghosh, Pallab.

Biology can be seen as the study of life and can be studied very broadly focusing on the whole planet or in very specific studies of for example microscopic structures like bacteria or DNA. We got an introduction to microbiology, the study of microorganisms, a diverse group of generally minute simple life-forms that include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. The field is concerned with the structure, function, and classification of such organisms and with ways of both exploiting and controlling their activities. Thereafter we made our own DIY laboratory and created an All Purpose Medium with simple ingredients that can be found in the local supermarket to grow and analyse living matter. We went hunting for bacteria and chose to take samples from the bathroom door handle and different fingerprints. This was placed in the incubator to later observe and analyse if or what kind of bacteria grows. We learned the importance of labelling and sorting samples to know what is what and how it has been handled, taking notes on recipes, procedures, changes and time slots. We learned the procedure of using scientific methods to experiment to be able to communicate and analyse outcomes. We looked at different tissue and organs through microscopes to understand how different microscopes work. Learning about the possibilities of making your own DIY microscope. With other recipes in the DIY Lab we made different Bio Materials, again with simple ingredients that can be found in supermarkets. Our group worked with Glycerine, Maizena and Vinegar, resulting in a Bio \u2018Plastic\u2019 with slightly transparent property depending on the thickness chosen. With flexible characteristics the thinnest sample seems to suit this recipe the best. Thereafter we learned how to grow Combucha and Spirulina. In the Agri part we learned about bees and beekeeping and farm projects with the use of technology. Throughout the course we have been working with theory alongside practical work. Learning how to work with DIY Bioplastics, as well as growing Spirulina, was very inspiring and something I\u2019ll be working with more at home to investigate recipes and textures. I\u2019m also interested to learn more about the opensource beehives and how to communicate these projects. Analysis - Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops Published 29 September 2021 By Pallab Ghosh In the BBC article \u2018Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops you can read about how the UK discusses allowing gene edited fruits and vegetables to be commercially grown and available. Due to Brexit, the UK is no longer a part of the European Union and therefor neither the restrictions they have regarding gene modified or edited farming and produce. Many scientists believe that they can use gene editing to develop fruit, vegetables and cereals that are more nutritious and productive, as well as hardier varieties that can withstand the extremes of weather brought about by climate change, but this is restricted in many countries (Ghosh, 2021). As populations keep growing it is expected that food production will have to double in the next 50 years. Unintentional environmental factors effect crops where an average of 33% of all fruit and vegetables are wasted or lost to causes such as disease, drought, extremes of temperature, and other environmental stresses. Plant gene editing has a profound potential to create new crops with desirable characteristics that could improve agricultural production. Manipulation of plant genomes has been achieved with the gene-editing tool CRISPR\u2013Cas9. Mutations in the genomes can apply and activate valuable traits in many crop species, such as lifecycles, additional nutrition and growth. This may improve the overall efficiency of fruit and vegetable production so that costs may be lowered, thereby bringing fresh produce within the means of more populations and strengthening the industry as well as worldwide health (Shipman, et al, 2021) These possibilities of changing the traits of produce to increase nutrition and production can definitely help solve some of the issues from growing populations and environmental impacts in the future, but at what cost? The article continues with discussing the UK governments future thoughts of also reviewing regulations of all genetically modified organisms which includes allowing commercial development and farming of gene-edited and genetically modified animals. This can make them more productive, resistant to some diseases and better withstand weather conditions. Many scientists and others within the field are welcoming these changes, while there are groups that are sceptical to the ethical impacts it can have on production methods and safety of animals and other living organisms. In another BBC article - \u2018Rules to create gene-edited farm animals must put welfare first - review\u2019 a report by the Nuffield Council for Bioethics warns that removing the current ban on the commercial development of gene-edited animals could increase livestock suffering. As farming is a business there can be different understandings and thoughts from breeders of farm animals where to tread a line between what they can get out of it and animal welfare. If gene edited animals could better tolerate poor conditions without any apparent health impacts it causes tension between the producer and animal welfare. In an experiment carried out during the 1980s a human gene was added into the DNA of pigs expecting them to grow faster and become leaner. The experiment succeeded where the pigs weight gain increased, together with feed efficiency, and carcass fat reduced. In a commercial and productive point of view this experiment was successful, but beyond these effects the pigs also suffered from several unanticipated serious health problems and suffering. \u201cThose involved in policing must look beyond solely questions of food safety and keep in mind an overall vision of a food and farming system that supports sustainable farming and improves standards of animal welfare (Ghosh, 2021).

Originally I thought I would want to save and store things in the companion that I find inspiring during the day, yet the opposite happened. I became very selective of what things I would consider carrying around because of the added weight it would include. It did however act as a great conversation starter of the impacts that our surroundings have on us, objects, spaces, media, mental health as some examples. The question of what is actually meaningful to the extent that you want to carry it with you, with the weight it brings. How do the surroundings and objects around us affect us and what weight do we carry with them? Do they weigh us down? How do thoughts and media affect us, when being connected to constant information flows, what follows us and do we actually choose to store this information or is it automatically stored? While reflecting on this, looking at this insect like object and imagining the body growing with things, you could visually see the legs becoming shorter and the body becoming heavier. Could this be a metaphor for the materialistic things we save and feel we need that the span and different directions we can reach with our \u2018legs\u2019 become shorter and we are weighed down by these things having a harder time to see things from other perspectives and move around in different spaces.

All of this without weighing down our bodies? What would happen if the companion did the opposite? What would I put inside that I don\u2019t want, and it would walk away with it? Although I usually work in this way, using myself as a tool, living with the ideas to test, this exercise was another level of doing this, as I was now also aware of doing it. It allows a place to start and then allows insights and other things to emerge along the way, giving deeper value to the insights or understanding that there are other subjects underlying what you thought you should work with.

Water is essential to all living things and access to fresh water should be a global right, yet in many parts of the world this is not the case where many people and living things are without access to freshwater. It made me wonder how much water I use daily and where this water comes from and how it\u2019s handled. During 24 hours I started to track and map the water that I used. It started at home, saving excess water in containers to understand how much water is wasted when washing hands, showering or washing dishes and other things. Very early on during the experiment I realised that I would be needing a lot of containers as they filled up extremely fast. When this water became visible I became very aware of the huge amounts of water I use, I also became very aware that this is the waste water that I can see. I began to investigate how much water that I can\u2019t see is used for the things that I don\u2019t associate with water, tracking water usage for food, clothes and objects. The insight of how much water is used during everyday life was intense, and when adding the water usage used for clothes, food, products etc I was shocked.

The technology that we see today is mostly a black box that has little transparency of how it works and operates. How does technology shape our lives? How do we operate it and and how does it operate us? Do we have a critical relationship to the technology around us, do we know where and who it comes from and what information it collects and how this is used? The answer to most of these questions is - we don\u2019t know - until we start taking back control of the technology around us and take action to owning our own products. We need to understand what it is we are using, how it affects us and the processes and systems around it. Most products don\u2019t have the possibility for consumers to manipulate or repair software or hardware. They are often hard or impossible to disassemble without breaking parts. Companies behind these products and services have many excuses to keep control of the things that we think that we own. It can be security excuses - that our products become insecure if we start disassembling and handling them ourselves, and that the warranty expires if we do. Companies might have their own repair systems, giving them full control of the product from purchase to return. We are supposed to agree to software that cannot be changed, agreeing to use products exactly as a company has chosen, meaning that they have actually just lent us the product and we are not free to use it as we like. This gives us no freedom or possibility to repair or know if the parts are faulty or preprogrammed to stop working. If we don\u2019t ourselves understand how things work we have to trust the companies and systems around us, while they don\u2019t trust us, and if we don\u2019t have any knowledge about these products or systems we can\u2019t doubt or question this trust. As products have gotten more difficult to understand and repair, a growing right-to-repair movement has been pushing for legislation that requires access to make information and repair tools available to users. What impact does that have on society when things are hidden from us, who has the control when knowledge and information is hidden from us? During the first week of Tech Beyond the Myth we disassembled electronic products that no longer function to be able to understand the technology used and how things are built, as well as understand how they can be hacked and used in different ways. It is a way of understanding how we can take back control over the products around us. In a group of 5 we disassembled a Brother Inkjet Printer/ Scanner to understand the different parts and technologies it consists of. It is made up of two overall parts, one for scanning and one for printing. The top part consists of the image scan & fax scan and the bottom part consists of a printer and paper trays. The casing is made of different types of plastic, ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) which has mechanical properties such as impact resistance, toughness, and rigidity, PS-HI (Polysterine high Impact) a hard, solid plastic used frequently in products requiring certain rigidity, whilst offering elasticity and a good capacity for absorbing impact, POM (Polyoxymethylene) which is used for precision parts requiring high stiffness, low friction, and excellent dimensional stability and PPE-PS (Polyphenylene Ether + Polystyrene) which is a ductile material with excellent hydrolytic stability, flame resistance, and UV resistance. These properties make it ideal for applications in the process engineering, electrical, and medical industries. When looking at the inside of the case, it consists of several different mechanical and electronic parts with PC Boards, sensors and motors. The parts inside are made of different materials, there are parts in plastic, metal, rubber, wire and felt absorbers. Inkjet printers contain thousands of tiny holes that eject microscopic ink droplets onto the paper that passes through the printer. This process is performed at high speed with thousands of droplets ejected simultaneously resulting in the digital text or image transferred onto paper. MFC printers from Brother use a liquid ink produced either by a coloured dye or a liquid that contains solid pigments in suspension. Scanners work by shining light at a document. In simple terms, the reflected light is then directed onto photosensitive technology via mirrors and lenses, then converted into electronic data that is used to form a digital copy of the original. The printer could be turned on and power supply to the unit was stable, although we couldn\u2019t perform a \u2018print or scan test\u2019 to determine the actual issue. Upon lighting up, the screen displayed messages and the touchscreen could be interacted with, although showing an error message about connection to the server. When disassembling there were no faulty or broken parts so we reflected on possible theories for failure. One possiblity could be the maintenance unit, which cleans the printing carriage and makes adjustments for precise printing. Having a faulty maintenance unit could imply incorrect ink supply to the carriage, where it could be supplying more or less ink than needed or no ink at all. The maintenance unit could also be full, something that could easily be changed, if it wasn\u2019t that it is so well packed inside the printer that changing or cleaning it means taking apart the whole printer. This could be prepogrammed to sell more printers instead of maintaining the one you already have. Other possible malfunctions could be the sensors, mechanical parts or the electronics inside. Again these parts could be repaired or replaced if it was not for how the printer is constructed and put together, where replacing separate parts inside the printer require the whole thing being disassembled. Disassembling the printer tells us a lot about how it is built and how it works, but it also tells us a lot about what the company manufacturing it wants. When identifying the complex systems within the printer and how it\u2019s constructed, it\u2019s is interesting to understand how it can be so sold at such a low price? The ink cartridges all had chips, which could be used to communicate to the printer how much ink there is left for example, yet there was no sensor reading these chips. This could be to secure that customers only buy this specific ink for the printer to work. The biggest incomes for the company is usually the ink, so you could wonder if these chips are preprogrammed to be empty before they are to sell more ink for example? Can you hack these chips to use other types of ink? The exercise helped remove fear of the \u2018black box\u2019, and learn how different aspects of technology work. By reverse engineering the printer we understood the complexity of a device that executes such simple tasks. A printer has complex integrated systems, components and technology almost as robust as a computer. It was also surprising to see the amount of parts and components and the complexity of processes and systems involved in printing or scanning. What is an almost useless machine? What can we do with the parts from the disassembled printer? How can we hack everyday products to use them in different ways? How can tinkering be used in the process to learn and understand things? Forensics Report https://hackmd.io/@8sCwEDXZRLu279SP363xRQ/SkVrxUbHj By using different electronic parts from the printer, we started playing around with their use and function. The printer had two types of motors - Stepper motors and DC Motors, and several different types of sensors - Switch and Light sensors. The DC Motor was programmed with Arduino to have different speeds and change directions within different time slots. One of the DC motors we were using had a mechanical arm attached, when it started hitting the table while interacting with it we found the rhythm of the different sounds it could make exciting to investigate more. Through this different ideas of sound, light and behaviour emerged through the chaos/ process of playing. We started connecting other parts, making lights blink and switches connect humans with the machine. It became a rhythm machine, or a knocking machine, or just an almost useless machine. It can be a prank you place on someones door, that knocks aggressively until the door is opened, just to restart as it is closed again.

The technology that we see today is mostly a black box that has little transparency of how it works and operates. How does technology shape our lives? How do we operate it and and how does it operate us? Do we have a critical relationship to the technology around us, do we know where and who it comes from and what information it collects and how this is used? The answer to most of these questions is - we don\u2019t know - until we start taking back control of the technology around us and take action to owning our own products. We need to understand what it is we are using, how it affects us and the processes and systems around it. Most products don\u2019t have the possibility for consumers to manipulate or repair software or hardware. They are often hard or impossible to disassemble without breaking parts. Companies behind these products and services have many excuses to keep control of the things that we think that we own. It can be security excuses - that our products become insecure if we start disassembling and handling them ourselves, and that the warranty expires if we do. Companies might have their own repair systems, giving them full control of the product from purchase to return. We are supposed to agree to software that cannot be changed, agreeing to use products exactly as a company has chosen, meaning that they have actually just lent us the product and we are not free to use it as we like. This gives us no freedom or possibility to repair or know if the parts are faulty or preprogrammed to stop working. If we don\u2019t ourselves understand how things work we have to trust the companies and systems around us, while they don\u2019t trust us, and if we don\u2019t have any knowledge about these products or systems we can\u2019t doubt or question this trust. As products have gotten more difficult to understand and repair, a growing right-to-repair movement has been pushing for legislation that requires access to make information and repair tools available to users. What impact does that have on society when things are hidden from us, who has the control when knowledge and information is hidden from us? During the first week of Tech Beyond the Myth we disassembled electronic products that no longer function to be able to understand the technology used and how things are built, as well as understand how they can be hacked and used in different ways. It is a way of understanding how we can take back control over the products around us. In a group of 5 we disassembled a Brother Inkjet Printer/ Scanner to understand the different parts and technologies it consists of. It is made up of two overall parts, one for scanning and one for printing. The top part consists of the image scan & fax scan and the bottom part consists of a printer and paper trays. The casing is made of different types of plastic, ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) which has mechanical properties such as impact resistance, toughness, and rigidity, PS-HI (Polysterine high Impact) a hard, solid plastic used frequently in products requiring certain rigidity, whilst offering elasticity and a good capacity for absorbing impact, POM (Polyoxymethylene) which is used for precision parts requiring high stiffness, low friction, and excellent dimensional stability and PPE-PS (Polyphenylene Ether + Polystyrene) which is a ductile material with excellent hydrolytic stability, flame resistance, and UV resistance. These properties make it ideal for applications in the process engineering, electrical, and medical industries. When looking at the inside of the case, it consists of several different mechanical and electronic parts with PC Boards, sensors and motors. The parts inside are made of different materials, there are parts in plastic, metal, rubber, wire and felt absorbers. Inkjet printers contain thousands of tiny holes that eject microscopic ink droplets onto the paper that passes through the printer. This process is performed at high speed with thousands of droplets ejected simultaneously resulting in the digital text or image transferred onto paper. MFC printers from Brother use a liquid ink produced either by a coloured dye or a liquid that contains solid pigments in suspension. Scanners work by shining light at a document. In simple terms, the reflected light is then directed onto photosensitive technology via mirrors and lenses, then converted into electronic data that is used to form a digital copy of the original. The printer could be turned on and power supply to the unit was stable, although we couldn\u2019t perform a \u2018print or scan test\u2019 to determine the actual issue. Upon lighting up, the screen displayed messages and the touchscreen could be interacted with, although showing an error message about connection to the server. When disassembling there were no faulty or broken parts so we reflected on possible theories for failure. One possiblity could be the maintenance unit, which cleans the printing carriage and makes adjustments for precise printing. Having a faulty maintenance unit could imply incorrect ink supply to the carriage, where it could be supplying more or less ink than needed or no ink at all. The maintenance unit could also be full, something that could easily be changed, if it wasn\u2019t that it is so well packed inside the printer that changing or cleaning it means taking apart the whole printer. This could be prepogrammed to sell more printers instead of maintaining the one you already have. Other possible malfunctions could be the sensors, mechanical parts or the electronics inside. Again these parts could be repaired or replaced if it was not for how the printer is constructed and put together, where replacing separate parts inside the printer require the whole thing being disassembled. Disassembling the printer tells us a lot about how it is built and how it works, but it also tells us a lot about what the company manufacturing it wants. When identifying the complex systems within the printer and how it\u2019s constructed, it\u2019s is interesting to understand how it can be so sold at such a low price? The ink cartridges all had chips, which could be used to communicate to the printer how much ink there is left for example, yet there was no sensor reading these chips. This could be to secure that customers only buy this specific ink for the printer to work. The biggest incomes for the company is usually the ink, so you could wonder if these chips are preprogrammed to be empty before they are to sell more ink for example? Can you hack these chips to use other types of ink? The exercise helped remove fear of the \u2018black box\u2019, and learn how different aspects of technology work. By reverse engineering the printer we understood the complexity of a device that executes such simple tasks. A printer has complex integrated systems, components and technology almost as robust as a computer. It was also surprising to see the amount of parts and components and the complexity of processes and systems involved in printing or scanning. What is an almost useless machine? What can we do with the parts from the disassembled printer? How can we hack everyday products to use them in different ways? How can tinkering be used in the process to learn and understand things? Forensics Report https://hackmd.io/@8sCwEDXZRLu279SP363xRQ/SkVrxUbHj By using different electronic parts from the printer, we started playing around with their use and function. The printer had two types of motors - Stepper motors and DC Motors, and several different types of sensors - Switch and Light sensors. The DC Motor was programmed with Arduino to have different speeds and change directions within different time slots. One of the DC motors we were using had a mechanical arm attached, when it started hitting the table while interacting with it we found the rhythm of the different sounds it could make exciting to investigate more. Through this different ideas of sound, light and behaviour emerged through the chaos/ process of playing. We started connecting other parts, making lights blink and switches connect humans with the machine. It became a rhythm machine, or a knocking machine, or just an almost useless machine. It can be a prank you place on someones door, that knocks aggressively until the door is opened, just to restart as it is closed again. Can that help people leave the house to go outside and enjoy nature, or is it a way to open doors and invite people to be more social, removing boundaries? Or can it be seen as all the information that is constantly being thrown at us through media, telling us what to do, who to be, how to be it, not stopping until we actively choose to remove ourselves from society?

Those promoting participatory action-research believe that people have a universal right to participate in the production of knowledge which is a disciplined process of personal and social transformation. In this process, people rupture their existing attitudes of silence, accommodation and passivity, and gain confidence and abilities to alter unjust conditions and structures. Design is changing. For many years design has been associated with the practice of problem solving to change situations into preferred ones and to how things ought to be by using rational and analytic techniques. But who decides what ought to be and who\u2019s preferred situations are being realised? And what happens when a problem has innumerable causes, the issue\u2019s roots are complex and tangled, describing it is difficult and it changes with every attempt to address it and doesn\u2019t have a right answer? The concept of wicked problems was proposed by Rittel and Webber in response to the then dominant rational problem-solving methodology. These types of problems are not receptive to standard analytical problem solving techniques and may even worsen situations by generating undesirable consequences. To approach and address the issues of todays society there is a need of fundamental change at every level that require new approaches to problem solving. It calls for new ways of designing that are based upon a deep understanding of how to design for change and transition within complex systems. There needs to be an understanding of the interconnectedness of social, economic, political and natural systems to address problems at all levels of spatiotemporal scale in ways that improve quality of life. Transition Design advocates the reconception of entire lifestyles, with the aim of making them more place-based, convivial and participatory and harmonising them with the natural environment. It focuses on the need for \u2018cosmopolitan local- ism\u2019, a lifestyle that is place-based and regional, yet global in its awareness and exchange of information and technology and argues that design has a key role to play in these transitions. Transition designers view everyday life as a potentially powerful, transformative space to explore ways in which basic human needs are satisfied locally, within economies that exist to meet those needs. They draw on knowledge and wisdom from the past to conceive solutions in the present with future generations in mind. They study how large socio technical transitions have manifested throughout history and draw on the wisdom of pre-industrial indigenous societies who lived and designed sustainably in-place for generations (1). So how do we engage with the system and communities? To understand wicked problems and how to work with systems change we have worked with different tools like enabling actions to map actors and resources, analysing local contexts, identifying potential synergies and opportunities, and amplifying key benefits for local stakeholders. 'Stop being blinded by the illusion of control, systems can\u2019t be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned.. We can expect surprises, learn from them and even profit from them. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone. \u201cWe can\u2019t control systems or figure them out. But we can dance with them!' An important part of working within systems and communities is to understand how they work and the value that is already there and to do that you have to become part of and work within it. Communicate and experiment ideas, and keep learning through trial and error. Understand the behaviour in the community and pay attention to triggering events and outside influences that change or bring forward specific behaviours. Can these be changed from the outside? While looking at this its important to remember to zoom in and out of parts while still looking to maximise the system as a whole. The aim should be to enhance total systems properties, such as creativity, stability, diversity, resilience, and sustainability. *\u201cBefore you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves. If it\u2019s a piece of music or a whitewater rapid or a fluctuation in a commodity price, study its beat. If it\u2019s a social system, watch it work. Learn its history.\u201d* (2) TOOLS \u00b7 MAPPING Through mapping systems and systems within systems the aim was to understand how things affect each other and where in these systems to intervene. Working in a group interested in waste streams, at the moment specifically food waste, we started mapping the subject and the systems that exist around us. Looking at the challenges, what already exists and how it has been worked with locally and globally. Now we wanted to understand ways of working with food waste in the systems around us. TOOLS \u00b7 SENSEMAKING Cognitive Psychologists Robert R. Hoffman, Gary Klein, and Brian M. Moon define sensemaking as \u201ca motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively\u201d (Klein, Moon, & Hoffman, 2006). A frame is an active perspective that both describes and perceptually changes a given situation We make sense of complicated ideas by doing them, rather than studying them abstractly. The process of sensemaking is a process of learning that relies on and is subjectively dependant on the entire summation of knowledge, emotions, and prior experiences in the learner. This builds heavily on John Dewey\u2019s view of experience as being fundamental for education, and implies that learning (and the process of solving complicated problems) must be an active process, and is always a subjective process. Reframing is the act of purposefully shifting the normative frame, often temporarily or in multiple directions at once, in order to see things from a new perspective. Designers may be able to manage multiple frames (commonly including \u201ctheir own\u201d, \u201cthe user\u2019s\u201c, and \u201cthe business\u2019s\u201c) and realize tradeoffs when various frames are given precedent (3). During this week we visited different creative communities to get an idea about how they work. We had seminars with Holon at Co\u00f2polis and learned ways of mapping communities and framing ideas and intervention points. We did a workshop in 4D mapping where the body is a means of framing a situation, where we worked with the subject of Higher Education. It was an interesting way to understand the complexity of systems and how we can understand them differently. We had already done an intervention within the group cooking with the food waste that we had saved during 3 days. It was an event that helped us understand the situation of individual food waste from a first person perspective and the possibilities that can be created with it. I learned a lot of ways to use all parts of vegetables and new recipes. To continue this intervention we have been looking for local creative communities within the area of Raval, a diverse and multicultural neighbourhood in Cuitat Vella, where some of us also live. A couple different opportunities arised with people in our surroundings that were also interested in the subject, including creating an art dinner with food waste, collecting food waste from a restaurant to experiment with biomaterials and the community garden Agora Juan Andres, where we will also be attending a community dinner that is arranged by the organisation Create Food not Bombs. During this community dinner we will be helping out during the event, but we also want to connect with the community and organisation and engage in possibilities of collaboration. We will also be observing and understanding the area and connections within it. *\u201dWe are all actors: being a citizen is not living in society, it is changing it.\u201d* - Augusto Boal SOURCES 1 https://design.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/Transition_Design_Monograph_final.pdf 2 https://donellameadows.org/dancing-with-systems/ 3 https://www.jonkolko.com/writingSensemaking.php","title":"Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20Engagement/#community-engagement","text":"During the past week we have been working with community engagement, understanding and learning about different tools to create local action-research projects with the goal of developing, testing, and implementing alternative and circular strategies towards a (more) locally productive and globally connected city.

What is intelligence? It can be defined in many ways, the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviours within an environment or context. Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. The Oxford English Dictionary of Oxford University Press defines artificial intelligence as: \u2018the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.\u2019 AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analysing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction. Learning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task (1). We were introduced to different AI tools and how AI embodied in art can be a communicative way to understand how it works and what you can do with it. Estampa showed us how they work and different models that they\u2019ve developed and how we could use them. We used the \u2026 and analysed photos with the AI tool \u2026 that is trained to capture and illustrate what is represented in the photo. I analysed photos taken during the semester showing waste I had collected during a week and food waste found on the street, as well as scraps from vegetables. All things in the photos are things that we as humans regard as waste, yet the \u2018machine\u2019 did represent even one object in the photos as waste. It analysed the photos and communicated what it analysed exactly for what it is, materials and resources. Can this tool help people understand what they see to understand objects as resources instead of waste? It is a very interesting tool that we\u2019ll be using in the project I\u2019m working on together with a group of students on the subject food waste. DREAMCATCHER \u00b7 CRYSTAL FUTURES During these weeks we have worked on a project with AI embodied as a Christal Ball that acts as a dreamcatcher and future teller. It retrieves peoples dreams through scanning brain activity and translating it into images, encrypts them and analyses the network of all peoples collective dreams to create individual predictions of the future. It is embodied as a Chrystal ball that is owned personally and can be engaged with through text or voice recognition, where you can ask it questions about the future and it will predict individualised responses in the form of images. Although a speculative project, it might not be farfetched from what could be reality in the future. There are already apps and projects working with AI to analyse dreams and there meanings, as well as projects working with scanning brain activity through fMRI, which is a neural decoding approach in which machine-learning models predict the contents of visual imagery during the sleep-onset period, given measured brain activity, by discovering links between human functional magnetic resonance imaging patterns and verbal reports with the assistance of lexical and image databases (2). Other projects are researching and experimenting with methods to incubate dreams serving as tools for education for enhanced learning, creativity and memory for example. Media Lab\u2019s Fluid Interfaces group calls this method \u201cTargeted Dream Incubation\u201d (TDI). \u2018This protocol, implemented through an app in conjunction with a wearable sleep-tracking sensor device, not only helps record dream reports, but also guides dreams toward particular themes by repeating targeted information at sleep onset, thereby enabling incorporation of this information into dream content\u2019 (3). This research points to the possibility of these functions being a reality in the future, which calls for understanding the ethics in collecting and manipulating peoples dreams. Who will have access to this technology and information? If the collective dream dataset is hacked - what unethical uses could it be applied to? Could marketing technologies become even more powerful? If you can read the innermost fears and desires of a population, how well can you manipulate it? This project can be seen as an embodiment questioning some of these questions and thoughts to create conversations.

Media Lab\u2019s Fluid Interfaces group calls this method \u201cTargeted Dream Incubation\u201d (TDI). \u2018This protocol, implemented through an app in conjunction with a wearable sleep-tracking sensor device, not only helps record dream reports, but also guides dreams toward particular themes by repeating targeted information at sleep onset, thereby enabling incorporation of this information into dream content\u2019 (3). This research points to the possibility of these functions being a reality in the future, which calls for understanding the ethics in collecting and manipulating peoples dreams. Who will have access to this technology and information? If the collective dream dataset is hacked - what unethical uses could it be applied to? Could marketing technologies become even more powerful? If you can read the innermost fears and desires of a population, how well can you manipulate it? This project can be seen as an embodiment questioning some of these questions and thoughts to create conversations.

Keeping an open mind and accepting the feeling of being lost were two of the most useful insights during the first term. By letting go of trying to control what we were gonna do and with who and how it would look and act etc, letting go became fuel for the project where lots of new contacts were made, and new opportunities arose. The term was compact with different courses that helped explore subjects from different perspectives. During the term I have personally worked on understanding my passions, communicating what I am good at within a group and practicing to communicate projects and thoughts verbally with contacts to find opportunities of intervention. The interventions that we did during the first term were a good way to use different channels and target groups to understand the subject from a broader perspective. Due to the time restrictions the interventions were lacking in depth and true time for deeper collaborations with communities. We had a thought of being able to connect on a deeper level with Food not bombs, to be able to try more things etc but it takes time to gain trust within a group and community. From Design Dialogues we got good feedback on how to proceed with investigating and understanding through which of these channels of people and communities we can create the most value. My Design Space remians very much the same as it did in the first term, where Regenerative Design lies in the centre. I have accompanied this Design space with a linear visualisation of how the different topics interact with eachother. During the second term I want to keep volunteering and working with Food not Bombs and Esperanca. There are connections between these organisations that can be interesting to keep working on together. I personally want to keep working with Bio Materials and waste as a hands on part of projects, as well as explore more with AI. Through the different activities the we got a good horizontal understanding of the subject. One of common links between all of the activities and target groups were sorting, storing and serving food and food waste. When working with Food Not Bombs, we might have had design in mind too early in the process, where it took longer time to gain trust within the community to actually start working together on some of the difficulties the organisation has with reaching intended target groups and logistics. We saw early on within the collaboration that they had problems with storage solutions for distribution of extra food. We started brainstorming about how to use food waste as packaging within the organisation as we also knew of upcoming laws in countries where restaurants have to ask if you want to take home your leftover food, wondering about how to make single use packaging. What happens when the UK bans single use plastics? What will happen to street food and the way that we eat? How will From a horizontal investigating and researching phase to understand the subject of food from different perspectives and target groups we got a broad overview of the subject of food and food waste. We found some areas that could be interesting to keep working with, such as the subject of packaging and materials. How can we apply bio materials to packaging and take away or single use products? What happens to existing systems when single use plastics and products are banned? Paraphernalia around food (everything around a subject of food for example or waste, accessories etc)- How can we work with secondary materials that aren\u2019t edible? Could secondary materials become a part of packaging? Creating a Second Cycle Everything, second use of food and where the waste becomes viable again.. What can we learn from systems around the world in different times and cultures? How have others get food on mass in remote/ difficult places? Looking at Tiffans in India, the system of transporting large amounts of lunchboxes to difficult locations. The emergence of this and the proudness there is around it. Alongside the extended work with waste and the channel food waste, I want to work with the subject of water. I started to understand during the first term that the subjects of food, water and energy are core subjects of interest. After the course Living with your own ideas I followed my water consumption during 24 hours looking at grey water, water usage from things I ate and wore and found the large amount of water consumption we use individually. When reflecting on how I could reduce this consumption the insight of how many invisible systems there are that I cannot myself choose to use or not and how hard it is to find information about it. I am at the moment exploring different ways to approach this broad subject, but seek to again be open minded about areas of intervention where a fluid process can lead to unexpected opportunities. Starting the term I am therefor exploring different perspectives and systems of water. I\u2019ll be visiting and investigating contacts and learning from how The Ocean Race and the event alongside it works, investigating possible collaborations and contacts. In the end of January I will together with some others interested in water, be going to the Waste Water Management in Barcelona to visit the centre and see how the city works with this. In December I visited a wastewater management outside of Gothenburg Sweden. This can be a great opportunity to look at similarities and differences between countries that have opposite relationships to water, where Gothenburg aims to become the best rain city and Spain and Barcelona are in long periods of drought. As a prolonging of these subjects I\u2019m continuing to work in the group where we are creating a Bio Design Dinner Experience, working with Bio Materials to create tableware and objects from the same materials with a special focus on the subject of ocean and plastic waste. The participants will be an interdiscplinary group of individuals with a background in this subject. while reading a performative dinner experience using these and eating the same materials. B I O D E S I G N D I N N E R Within the project we have kept experimenting with Bio Materials and different waste streams to find a material to fit the theme of oceans and the natural materials that exist there. During the first term when working with food waste and Bio Materials I experimented with a recipe of coRncrete, where I mixed cornflour, water and different types of food waste to create a very hard concrete like material. The original recipe is with the additive sand which I have now incorporated and will be experimenting with to create tableware for the dinner. CoRncrete is a very interesting material that is very hard and durable, yet before heating it is completely dry and doesn\u2019t hold the form at all. What I have experienced so far it that it has been hard to find moulds that are suitable to be able to put quite high pressure on the material without the mould deforming while still being very thin, as this makes the material harden in the best way in the microwave. I\u2019ll therefor be further experimenting and investigating different types of moulds in various sizes and materials to be able to create plates in various forms and sizes. We have also experimented with switching the sand with Calcium Carbonate in pure powder which creates a fine finsih, but is not as strong, so we\u2019ll be looking at different ratios in the recipe. Furthermore we have been in contact with different restuarants that can provide us with seashells from their waste which we will also be using to experiment with this recipe. Alongside investigating form with Corncrete I\u2019ve been experimenting with coating with Shellac. We want to see if we could use this as a food safe water resistant coating to Bio Materials. O C E A N & P L A S T I C Every Saturday I have been volunteering together with Sami at the beach clean up in Barceloneta that is organised by Clean Beach Initiative. It started out as a part of the Bio Design Dinner project to understand how organisations in the neighbourhood work with ocean waste and gathering communities to clean the beach. It was for me a wonderful experience to meet people at the beach every Saturday and has become therapeutic when wandering Barceloneta solely focusing on the small colorful pieces of waste in the sand. Although a great experience in the moment for my own peace of mind it is also an eyopening experience. Looking at the beach in Barceloneta during this time of year, it can at first glance look quite clean although there is visible trash in places. It is when looking down that the colorful small pieces of microplastics become visible and as soon as you zoom in it\u2019s impossible to stop because its never ending. What becomes even worse is when thinking that most pieces are small parts of shells that would be a natural part of sand and then realizing that most of them are pieces of plastic. Clean Beach Initiative organizes beach clean ups every Saturday and provide bags and gloves for collection. They arrange people in groups to clean on different parts of the beach. Everything collected is then sorted and weighed to therafter be recycled or thrown away. Those who want then go to a bar around the corner and have a drink together. The bar always has a table reserved for the group, regardless of how full the terrace is. From the first experience we realised the amount of small microplastics in the sand and how hard it is to collect these pieces, regarding the amount and with gloves. The second time we went we started experimenting with different types of nets to siv the sand and collect a larger amount of small pieces. We\u2019re experimenting with different forms and how this could be integrated in the practice to collect more in the same amount of time. We also want to look at what can be done with the waste or if we can integrate other communities in the practice. W A T E R The subject of water is broad and I am yet to find exactly where within this area I am the most interested and where to intervene. My overall points of interest have been to understand the water systems in the city of Barcelona and to communicate where people can find information about this wide subject to themselves understand the resource we so often take for granted. To create change and awareness in behaviours through an artefact that can collect greywater to be reused. To start out with understanding water systems in Barcelona we visited the waste water plant in el Prat de Llobregat where we got to see how wastewater goes through the plant and where it goes. This plant receives a large part of Barcelonas greywater and storm water. These two streams are mixed and arrive at the water plant where they go through several stages of treatment, where one part goes to the sea and a second part goes through and extra treatment and is then repurposed to cleaning streets, filling fountains and water urban plants in the city. It was interesting to hear that greywater and storm water were mixed and then going through the water plant where they have different quality and are then mixed. In many places storm water is stored in cities to be used directly to water urban plants for example. So why is energy being used to move storm water that is clean enough for plants together with grey water that needs to be treated before it can return into the natural water cycle? The waste water plant treats .. of water every day. It has a loop system where the slam from the water is used to mkae biogas that runs the plant. With heavy rain and flooding the plant is under large pressure and releases water with lower quality into the sea. Could this be escaped by decreasing the amount of grey water entering the water plant? M A T E R I A L I N V E S T I G A T I O N S During this second term we had the course Remixing Materials where I together with Cagsun and Claudia experimented with Shellac as an alternative to silicone, using it as a sealant and adhesive in different ways. Shellac has historically been used for these purposes, but along with new technologies and synthetic adhesives such as silicone, that is easier to use, it is now mostly used for woodwork etc. Along with the overall concept of creating a system that collects water and uses clay to filter or absorb the water to also be space for plants I have continued to experiment with Shellac, implementing it as a coating to unprocessed and unfired clay to investigate if it could bring water resistant properties to the material and in that case be used as a water sealant when 3D printing with clay for example. I worked with a ratio of Shellac and Alcohol with a very rinny constistancy to be able to paint the pieces of clay with the mixture. They were coated with different layers to be able to test if there are differences in water resistance. Although it increases the water resistance, it doesn\u2019t completely make the clay water proof. After 12 hours with water inside, it still holds it form somewhat and doesnt complelty dissolve as it naturally would, but it does deteriorate enough to not be able to hold water.

Keeping an open mind and accepting the feeling of being lost were two of the most useful insights during the first term. By letting go of trying to control what we were gonna do and with who and how it would look and act etc, letting go became fuel for the project where lots of new contacts were made, and new opportunities arose. The term was compact with different courses that helped explore subjects from different perspectives. During the term I have personally worked on understanding my passions, communicating what I am good at within a group and practicing to communicate projects and thoughts verbally with contacts to find opportunities of intervention. The interventions that we did during the first term were a good way to use different channels and target groups to understand the subject from a broader perspective. Due to the time restrictions the interventions were lacking in depth and true time for deeper collaborations with communities. We had a thought of being able to connect on a deeper level with Food not bombs, to be able to try more things etc but it takes time to gain trust within a group and community. From Design Dialogues we got good feedback on how to proceed with investigating and understanding through which of these channels of people and communities we can create the most value. My Design Space remians very much the same as it did in the first term, where Regenerative Design lies in the centre. I have accompanied this Design space with a linear visualisation of how the different topics interact with eachother. During the second term I want to keep volunteering and working with Food not Bombs and Esperanca. There are connections between these organisations that can be interesting to keep working on together. I personally want to keep working with Bio Materials and waste as a hands on part of projects, as well as explore more with AI. Through the different activities the we got a good horizontal understanding of the subject. One of common links between all of the activities and target groups were sorting, storing and serving food and food waste. When working with Food Not Bombs, we might have had design in mind too early in the process, where it took longer time to gain trust within the community to actually start working together on some of the difficulties the organisation has with reaching intended target groups and logistics. We saw early on within the collaboration that they had problems with storage solutions for distribution of extra food. We started brainstorming about how to use food waste as packaging within the organisation as we also knew of upcoming laws in countries where restaurants have to ask if you want to take home your leftover food, wondering about how to make single use packaging. What happens when the UK bans single use plastics? What will happen to street food and the way that we eat? How will From a horizontal investigating and researching phase to understand the subject of food from different perspectives and target groups we got a broad overview of the subject of food and food waste. We found some areas that could be interesting to keep working with, such as the subject of packaging and materials. How can we apply bio materials to packaging and take away or single use products? What happens to existing systems when single use plastics and products are banned? Paraphernalia around food (everything around a subject of food for example or waste, accessories etc)- How can we work with secondary materials that aren\u2019t edible? Could secondary materials become a part of packaging? Creating a Second Cycle Everything, second use of food and where the waste becomes viable again.. What can we learn from systems around the world in different times and cultures? How have others get food on mass in remote/ difficult places? Looking at Tiffans in India, the system of transporting large amounts of lunchboxes to difficult locations. The emergence of this and the proudness there is around it. Alongside the extended work with waste and the channel food waste, I want to work with the subject of water. I started to understand during the first term that the subjects of food, water and energy are core subjects of interest. After the course Living with your own ideas I followed my water consumption during 24 hours looking at grey water, water usage from things I ate and wore and found the large amount of water consumption we use individually. When reflecting on how I could reduce this consumption the insight of how many invisible systems there are that I cannot myself choose to use or not and how hard it is to find information about it. I am at the moment exploring different ways to approach this broad subject, but seek to again be open minded about areas of intervention where a fluid process can lead to unexpected opportunities. Starting the term I am therefor exploring different perspectives and systems of water. I\u2019ll be visiting and investigating contacts and learning from how The Ocean Race and the event alongside it works, investigating possible collaborations and contacts. In the end of January I will together with some others interested in water, be going to the Waste Water Management in Barcelona to visit the centre and see how the city works with this. In December I visited a wastewater management outside of Gothenburg Sweden. This can be a great opportunity to look at similarities and differences between countries that have opposite relationships to water, where Gothenburg aims to become the best rain city and Spain and Barcelona are in long periods of drought. As a prolonging of these subjects I\u2019m continuing to work in the group where we are creating a Bio Design Dinner Experience, working with Bio Materials to create tableware and objects from the same materials with a special focus on the subject of ocean and plastic waste. The participants will be an interdiscplinary group of individuals with a background in this subject. while reading a performative dinner experience using these and eating the same materials. B I O D E S I G N D I N N E R Within the project we have kept experimenting with Bio Materials and different waste streams to find a material to fit the theme of oceans and the natural materials that exist there. During the first term when working with food waste and Bio Materials I experimented with a recipe of coRncrete, where I mixed cornflour, water and different types of food waste to create a very hard concrete like material. The original recipe is with the additive sand which I have now incorporated and will be experimenting with to create tableware for the dinner. CoRncrete is a very interesting material that is very hard and durable, yet before heating it is completely dry and doesn\u2019t hold the form at all. What I have experienced so far it that it has been hard to find moulds that are suitable to be able to put quite high pressure on the material without the mould deforming while still being very thin, as this makes the material harden in the best way in the microwave. I\u2019ll therefor be further experimenting and investigating different types of moulds in various sizes and materials to be able to create plates in various forms and sizes. We have also experimented with switching the sand with Calcium Carbonate in pure powder which creates a fine finsih, but is not as strong, so we\u2019ll be looking at different ratios in the recipe. Furthermore we have been in contact with different restuarants that can provide us with seashells from their waste which we will also be using to experiment with this recipe. Alongside investigating form with Corncrete I\u2019ve been experimenting with coating with Shellac. We want to see if we could use this as a food safe water resistant coating to Bio Materials. O C E A N & P L A S T I C Every Saturday I have been volunteering together with Sami at the beach clean up in Barceloneta that is organised by Clean Beach Initiative. It started out as a part of the Bio Design Dinner project to understand how organisations in the neighbourhood work with ocean waste and gathering communities to clean the beach. It was for me a wonderful experience to meet people at the beach every Saturday and has become therapeutic when wandering Barceloneta solely focusing on the small colorful pieces of waste in the sand. Although a great experience in the moment for my own peace of mind it is also an eyopening experience. Looking at the beach in Barceloneta during this time of year, it can at first glance look quite clean although there is visible trash in places. It is when looking down that the colorful small pieces of microplastics become visible and as soon as you zoom in it\u2019s impossible to stop because its never ending. What becomes even worse is when thinking that most pieces are small parts of shells that would be a natural part of sand and then realizing that most of them are pieces of plastic. Clean Beach Initiative organizes beach clean ups every Saturday and provide bags and gloves for collection. They arrange people in groups to clean on different parts of the beach. Everything collected is then sorted and weighed to therafter be recycled or thrown away. Those who want then go to a bar around the corner and have a drink together. The bar always has a table reserved for the group, regardless of how full the terrace is. From the first experience we realised the amount of small microplastics in the sand and how hard it is to collect these pieces, regarding the amount and with gloves. The second time we went we started experimenting with different types of nets to siv the sand and collect a larger amount of small pieces. We\u2019re experimenting with different forms and how this could be integrated in the practice to collect more in the same amount of time. We also want to look at what can be done with the waste or if we can integrate other communities in the practice. W A T E R The subject of water is broad and I am yet to find exactly where within this area I am the most interested and where to intervene. My overall points of interest have been to understand the water systems in the city of Barcelona and to communicate where people can find information about this wide subject to themselves understand the resource we so often take for granted. To create change and awareness in behaviours through an artefact that can collect greywater to be reused. To start out with understanding water systems in Barcelona we visited the waste water plant in el Prat de Llobregat where we got to see how wastewater goes through the plant and where it goes. This plant receives a large part of Barcelonas greywater and storm water. These two streams are mixed and arrive at the water plant where they go through several stages of treatment, where one part goes to the sea and a second part goes through and extra treatment and is then repurposed to cleaning streets, filling fountains and water urban plants in the city. It was interesting to hear that greywater and storm water were mixed and then going through the water plant where they have different quality and are then mixed. In many places storm water is stored in cities to be used directly to water urban plants for example. So why is energy being used to move storm water that is clean enough for plants together with grey water that needs to be treated before it can return into the natural water cycle? The waste water plant treats .. of water every day. It has a loop system where the slam from the water is used to mkae biogas that runs the plant.

The studio works with reimagining the digital economy to encourage regeneration and interspecies communality, helping citizens and organisations to make better decisions using future design tools. We worked with different ways of exploring hypothetical questions and critical hope to imagine new futures with many collective discussions and reflections over subjects that can help explore topics to expand the imagination. \u2018The Everything Manifesto\u2019 from IAM studio was a core part of the course with a collection of proposals for changing humans complicated relationship with change. It aims to explain and propose how hypothetical questions can be used to expand the imagination and help organisations and citizens to understand complex situations and how they work with the concept of \u201cwhat if\u201d and the understanding of \u2018everything\u2019 for designing beyond boarders. \u2018Hypotheticals make visible possible worlds and worlds of possibilities, creating playgrounds where we can exercise both our imagination and skepticism.

A tool to imagine how a day in your life could look like in an imaginative future of how you would like the world to be. It was a great way to brainstorm and get into a creative flow. For me it helped to answer the questions rapidly without too much time to think, and then afterwards reflecting on how this imaginative future could be realised and what difficulties could arise on the way there. By doing it quickly a couple of times, different scenarios arose that could then be combined and imagined in different times and places in the world. Another exercise was to write a handwritten first draft of a letter sent by your future-self, in the 2050s. For me this was also a good way to get into a creative flow and letting the imagination flow. Something I will use to \u2018brainstorm\u2019 and get started in opening up thoughts. The everything manifesto and during the course language, words and the way things are communicated were topics that were very interesting. We spoke about that there is no singular future but plural futures, something that I will adapt in my communication. There is no one solution for all, therefor there is no one ultimate future, but multiple futures that coexist and interrelate. This also involves the word design, as there is no ultimate solution to the complex emergency the world is facing, but there is ongoing designing of multiple futures, where designing and rapidly testing along the way is an ongoing and not ending practice. We also spoke about how the using the word climate change is to neglect what is actually happening in the world where IAM studio proposes to call it an environmental emergency where climate change is one of the symptoms. Using the term climate change can be a dangerous act of neglecting the actual cause, increasing the damage of what is already happening. How we communicate and what words we use can help change mindsets and understandings. Can using the terminology of the next billion seconds help people relate to time in a different way instead of saying 31,7 years? Where \u2018years\u2019 become too far away to relate to? Along with alternative futures we spoke about alternative economies such as the theory of Degrowth. Degrowth broadly means to shrink rather than grow economies, to use less of the world\u2019s energy and resources and put wellbeing ahead of profit. The idea is that by pursuing degrowth policies, economies can help themselves, their citizens and the planet by becoming more sustainable. Practical actions could include buying less, growing your own food and using empty houses instead of building new ones ( https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/06/what-is-degrowth-economics-climate-change/ ). As a theory meaning to be positive it\u2019s interesting that the term is emphasised in a negative way. Could this way of communicating the theory cause it to be understood incorrectly? Our society is built upon the belief that we need to always grow to succeed, personally, socially, financially. But what does it really mean to grow? How can that be reframed and revalued? Is it instead that we want to evolve? Can Degrowth be \u2018Inter-evolve\u2019 where the planet, citizens and economy can mutually evolve and move forward. During a session in the course speaking about regrowth we spoke about western society\u2019s linear way of acting. A line comes from the angle, something that cannot be seen anywhere in natural forms except those that have been made by mankind. Adding an arrow to the line being a power narrative being a dictation of how growth has no limit, its a linear way of thinking and living where the goal is to \u2018grow\u2019 economically, ad in power etc. In indigenous cultures and communities there are no lines but spirals - of life, the way of living, acting, nature. How can we show other ways of growing, how can we change to a system like this, something that can be very hard to imagine how to do as an individual, and how to change enough mindsets of other individuals to become a collective movement? https://www.canva.com/design/DAFXjrAtyJQ/view?utm_content=DAFXjrAtyJQ&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=viewer","title":"Designing for the Next Billion Seconds"},{"location":"term2/02-Designing%20for%20the%20Next%20Billion%20Seconds/#d-e-s-i-g-n-i-n-g-f-o-r-t-h-e-n-e-x-t-b-i-l-l-i-o-n-s-e-c-o-n-d-s","text":"11.01.23 - 13.01.23 Josephine Bourghardt The first week of the second term we had the course Designing for the Next Billion Seconds with Andres Colmenares the co founder of IAM Studio.

With collected waste from around the city we prototyped with different recipes to understand qualities and properties of different techniques and combinations. During the first semester I, together with a group of four others, explored Bio Materials and waste, specifically food waste, which made this course an engaging continuation of the explorations we had started, specifically learning more about processes and methods that can be used when collecting, processing, manipulating and manufacturing. We were introduced to different methods of analysing and visualising use and life cycles and how and where we could project thoughts into our surroundings. We looked at lifecycles and processes of extraction & processing, manufacturing/crafting, (casting, molding, shaping, joining, surfacing, additive), manufacturing (printing, extruding), subtractive, manufacturing (milling, drilling), blowing, melting, pressing, cooking, cutting, drying, sculpting, carving, grinding, mixing, sanding, etc., consumption/use and end of the life and disposal. During the first term we mostly explored different recipes and possibilities, where during this term and this course I want to evolve this work and explore the different manufacturing processes we\u2019ve been introduced to such as 3D printing, moulding, casting and milling with Bio Materials. With the course I also want to explore and learn more about how to express different applications of materials, and how to create communicative and relatable narratives and mediums of expression. MATERIAL NARRATIVE EXCERCISE GROWING MATERIALS with S Bi\u00f3tica We visited S Biotic and their studio where we were introduced to their practice and how the use and learn from growing living materials. We spoke about how materials can be living and transforming as we do with their own communication and narratives, rhythms and cycles. We are living in a time where we as consumers are detached from the materials around us. How can taking a step back to reflect and analyse on how materials make you feel, think, connect and collaborate with non human life, organic and living materials create a regenerative connection to the world and our surroundings? An interesting topic is how we live in an ever changing world but still have the perception that the things that we make and the materials we produce need to hold for a very long time. What if we were to instead mimic the aspect of the living, using the life cycle in design processes and other directions and question what is it to be and think with care when designing with the living around us. Should materials and products really hold for hundreds of years, or could the lifespan of a material be only of what it is to be used for and later deteriorate and return to nature with the nutrients needed. It was also interesting to talk about how working with other living organisms is a collaboration between a designer and other living things. You can tell it what to do, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it will do it. An aspect that can be hard to grasp within traditional design thinking where human needs are at the centre of solutions and humans have controlled the outcomes. Letting go of control as a designer and letting others be a part of deciding the process is what can lead to innovation solutions, as seen in many topics of collaborations between disciplines, so collaborating with other living organisms should be a natural part of this process as well. To understand this collaboration hands-on we worked with mycelium, learning about the specific properties, feeding, temperature and processes for it to grow in molds that we brought. 3D PRINTING WITH BIO MATERIAL PASTE During the second week we were introduced to the 3D printers that FabLab have been working on to self fabricate and 3D print with paste such as clay and Bio Materials. We worked hands on printing with both materials to understand how clay and bio materials react and behave when printed. I have 3D printed before using plastics and explored 3D printing with clay, but to use Bio Materials was a new experience, one that is very interesting in the projects that I worked on together with my group during the first term, as well as the continuation of them in the second term. By 3D printing waste can be reduced within the manufacturing process and create possibilities of closed loop material systems where waste can become new materials, composted or reused. There are also interesting projects where living cells are incorporated into 3D printed materials creating functional and biological active structures. MOLD // CASTING We were also introduced to moulding and casting and the techniques that can be used, understanding material properties and what moulds could be sufficient and work well with different Bio Materials. I am together with a couple of others working on a project exploring BioMaterials and how the form of tableware and objects in a dining experience affect the experience of eating. Exploring form, texture, biomaterials, perceptions and senses in the relationship we have with food, waste, eating and cooking. We experimented with casting pine resin and food waste. We used simple moulds, in silicone as well as everyday objects, and clay moulds. Due to the mixture of pine resin and the amount of additives, where we explored coffee grounds and orange peels, we had difficulties filling out the moulds and removing the cast. 3D printing can be an alternative here, as well as casting in soft silicone moulds where the material can be removed more easily. These techniques are also interesting in experimenting with printing clay to create a modular system of water collecting pots where individuals can collect grey water to reuse as well as experiment with growing directly in or on the pot. MATERIAL NARRATIVES Throughout the two weeks I was working together with Claudia and Cagsun exploring the techninques we learned and investigating the materal propoerties and use of the Shellac as an alternative to silcone. As part of a project working with water we wanted to investigate a bio material that can seal or act with water restistant properties. We experimented with different Shellac recipes and applications to learn how it reacts with different materials and how it could be applied to the grey water collection module system we are working on this term. It has sealing propoerties and could be a good alternative to using silicone. It can be reheated and reworked and could be used to seal modular pieces. We will further be experimenting with using it as a varnish on unfired clay to investigate if a clay form could be water resistant, while still holding moist to also hold plants.","title":"Remixing Materials"},{"location":"term2/03-Remixing%20Materials/#r-e-m-i-x-i-n-g-m-a-t-e-r-i-a-l-s","text":"18.01.23 - 20.01.23 Continuing into the second week of Term II we dove deeper into the principles of Bio Materials, with new techniques of creation, manipulation, understanding possibilities of use and communication strategies.

What if we were to instead mimic the aspect of the living, using the life cycle in design processes and other directions and question what is it to be and think with care when designing with the living around us. Should materials and products really hold for hundreds of years, or could the lifespan of a material be only of what it is to be used for and later deteriorate and return to nature with the nutrients needed. It was also interesting to talk about how working with other living organisms is a collaboration between a designer and other living things. You can tell it what to do, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it will do it. An aspect that can be hard to grasp within traditional design thinking where human needs are at the centre of solutions and humans have controlled the outcomes. Letting go of control as a designer and letting others be a part of deciding the process is what can lead to innovation solutions, as seen in many topics of collaborations between disciplines, so collaborating with other living organisms should be a natural part of this process as well. To understand this collaboration hands-on we worked with mycelium, learning about the specific properties, feeding, temperature and processes for it to grow in molds that we brought. 3D PRINTING WITH BIO MATERIAL PASTE During the second week we were introduced to the 3D printers that FabLab have been working on to self fabricate and 3D print with paste such as clay and Bio Materials. We worked hands on printing with both materials to understand how clay and bio materials react and behave when printed. I have 3D printed before using plastics and explored 3D printing with clay, but to use Bio Materials was a new experience, one that is very interesting in the projects that I worked on together with my group during the first term, as well as the continuation of them in the second term. By 3D printing waste can be reduced within the manufacturing process and create possibilities of closed loop material systems where waste can become new materials, composted or reused. There are also interesting projects where living cells are incorporated into 3D printed materials creating functional and biological active structures. MOLD // CASTING We were also introduced to moulding and casting and the techniques that can be used, understanding material properties and what moulds could be sufficient and work well with different Bio Materials. I am together with a couple of others working on a project exploring BioMaterials and how the form of tableware and objects in a dining experience affect the experience of eating. Exploring form, texture, biomaterials, perceptions and senses in the relationship we have with food, waste, eating and cooking. We experimented with casting pine resin and food waste. We used simple moulds, in silicone as well as everyday objects, and clay moulds. Due to the mixture of pine resin and the amount of additives, where we explored coffee grounds and orange peels, we had difficulties filling out the moulds and removing the cast. 3D printing can be an alternative here, as well as casting in soft silicone moulds where the material can be removed more easily. These techniques are also interesting in experimenting with printing clay to create a modular system of water collecting pots where individuals can collect grey water to reuse as well as experiment with growing directly in or on the pot. MATERIAL NARRATIVES Throughout the two weeks I was working together with Claudia and Cagsun exploring the techninques we learned and investigating the materal propoerties and use of the Shellac as an alternative to silcone. As part of a project working with water we wanted to investigate a bio material that can seal or act with water restistant properties. We experimented with different Shellac recipes and applications to learn how it reacts with different materials and how it could be applied to the grey water collection module system we are working on this term. It has sealing propoerties and could be a good alternative to using silicone. It can be reheated and reworked and could be used to seal modular pieces. We will further be experimenting with using it as a varnish on unfired clay to investigate if a clay form could be water resistant, while still holding moist to also hold plants.","title":"R E M I X I N G  -  M A T E R I A L S"},{"location":"term2/04-Prototyping%20for%20Design/","text":"P R O T O T Y P I N G - F O R - D E S I G N \u00b6 This section will be part of a weekly journal where I\u2019ll be documenting what we are doing during the course Prototyping for Design.

Since I haven\u2019t worked with it before the one week course during the first term I will be documenting this step by step for remembering how to get started in the future. Creating music with Arduino and buzzers We used a ESP32 microcontroller, a Piezo buzzer that is an electronic component that can make sounds, beeps or play music, a bread board and connection wires and pins which are then connected through Arduino IDE and code to make sounds. There are lots of tutorials that show how to do this exercise where I followed this one for setting up the microcontroller, breadboard and buzzer. For the code I used an already existing one where I practiced creating a loop instead of the music stopping and tried different melodies. For me, this exercise was a good refresh in what we did in the first term, allowing me to in a simple exercise practice restarting Arduino IDE, where we hade to reinstall a new version, but most of all it was a good way to learn how to search for information about how to get started with projects and what to search for to find relevant information. D I G I T A L I Z I N G - R E A L I T I E S 02.02.23 Today we had a presentation about digital tools for 2D, 3D, parametric and generative deisgn. We started off by communally adding programs we have worked with in the past to a Miroboard. I have used 2D and 3D programs for modelling before such as Illustrator, Rhino, Solidworks, Grasshopper, Sketchup to create 3D and 2D models and files for digital manufacturing, where I now saw so many interesting programs and other ways of working. Although I have worked in 2D and 3D to create models and files for digital fabrication there were many terms and things I was not aware about or not complete sure of why I used, I had just learnt that that\u2019s how you do it. List Computer Aided Design (CAD) Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the foundation of digital transformation in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. A holistic process of creating and managing information for a built asset. Based on an intelligent model and enabled by a cloud platform, BIM integrates structured, multi-disciplinary data to produce a digital representation of an asset across its lifecycle, from planning and design to construction and operations. Pixel: square in a x/y grid, smallest unit of bitmap images (called rester image or bitmap)average phone take millions of pixels in an image (GPU processed) Light data to store but heavy file. In Computer graphics, a pixel, dot, or picture element is a physical point in a picture. A pixel is simply the smallest addressable element of a picture represented on a screen. A majority of pictures that we see on our computer screen are raster images. The selfie that you click with your mobile phone is another example of a raster image. An image is made up using a collection of pixels referred to as a bitmap. Each pixel is made up of RGB sub pixels. It allows to store complex textures and gradients. It has multiple formats with a variety of compressions and processing requires less processor load. It needs a lot of RAM to store textures and uses a lot of memory. It loses quality when enlarged Bitmap: In computer graphics, a bitmap is a mapping from some domain (for example, a range of integers) to bits, that is, values which are zero or one. It is also called a bit array or bitmap index. The more general term pixmap refers to a map of pixels, where each one may store more than two colors, thus using more than one bit per pixel. Often bitmap is used for this as well. In some contexts, the term bitmap implies one bit per pixel, while pixmap is used for images with multiple bits per pixel. Raster - Raster images use bit maps to store information. This means a large file needs a large bitmap. The larger the image, the more disk space the image file will take up. As an example, a 640 x 480 image requires information to be stored for 307,200 pixels, while a 3072 x 2048 image (from a 6.3 Megapixel digital camera) needs to store information for a whopping 6,291,456 pixels. We use algorithms that compress images to help reduce these file sizes. Image formats like jpeg and gif are common compressed image formats. Scaling down these images is easy but enlarging a bitmap makes it pixelated or simply blurred. Hence for images that need to scale to different sizes, we use vector graphics. File extensions: .BMP, .TIF, .GIF, .JPG Vector - The geometrical (mathematical) description of an image. It can be enlarged as many times as you want without losing quality and allows for easy editing and changes. It is also lighter than pixel format images. Making use of sequential commands or mathematical statements or programs which place lines or shapes in a 2-D or 3-D environment is referred to as Vector Graphics. Vector graphics are best for printing since it is composed of a series of mathematical curves. As a result vector graphics print crisply even when they are enlarged. In physics: A vector is something that has a magnitude and direction. In vector graphics, the file is created and saved as a sequence of vector statements. Rather than having a bit in the file for each bit of line drawing, we use commands which describe a series of points to be connected. As a result, a much smaller file is obtained. The cons with vector formats are that they don\u2019t store texture and don\u2019t allow complex gradients as in photography. File extensions: SVG, EPS, PDF, AI, DXF Basics of a computer \u00b7 CPU \u00b7 Vector. heavy mathematical equations \u00b7 Constructed from millions of transistors, the CPU can have multiple processing cores and is commonly referred to as the brain of the computer. It is essential to all modern computing systems as it executes the commands and processes needed for your computer and operating system. The CPU is also important in determining how fast programs can run, from surfing the web to building spreadsheets. GPU \u00b7 Graphic Processing Unit \u00b7 Raster. The GPU is a processor that is made up of many smaller and more specialized cores. By working together, the cores deliver massive performance when a processing task can be divided up and processed across many cores. RGB stands for red, green and blue. RGB uses light to produce color: the more illuminated light involved, the lighter the image. RGB produces the widest range of color. RGB colors are typically used on computer monitors, digital cameras and televisions \u2014 any device that uses light to produce an image. CMYK stands for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. This category of color uses the combination of ink pigments to produce color. The less ink used, the lighter the image; the more ink used, the darker the image. Printing projects typically use the CMYK color category. sRGB (storeRGB) Color utility, mainly used on internet, save as this when uploading. It has less cooler rendering and shouldn\u2019t be used for printing. Resolution is the product of width and height of a digital image expressed in pixels. How many pixels and the density are measured in pixels per inch (PPI) and are what determine the quality of an image 72 PPI used on the Internet 300 PPI high resolution image 320 PPI average of what a human eye can see 600 PPI are used in professional printers Phone screens today have normally around 400-600 pixel, some 900. can\u2019t see the difference, marketing sales point FILE FORMATS JPEG file compressing, loses quality for every time its opened PNG compression less - heavier image, but doesn\u2019t lose quality MESH // NURBS NURBS model consists of points connected by curves. (freeform modeling, fluid shapes with a lot of complexity, at the same time being easy to modify.) Its a mathematical model used in computer graphics to generate curves and surfaces. It generates a precise geometry with smooth surfaces with geometries that are mathematically defined using control points that create complex curves to form surfaces around them. Used by many 3D scans and is ideal for CAD based programs as it is more accurate, takes less space and is easy to translate to different programs. MESH, GPU - A collection of verticles, edges and faces as a structural construction of a 3D model consisting of triangles, quadrilateral or other polygons. 3D meshes use reference points of x,y, z axes to define shapes with width, height and depth. Object smoothness is achieved by increasing the number of polygons within a model, this also affects the filesize making it very heavy. Not good for scaling as the polygons increase or decrease in size while scaling affecting the surface and form. STL file for manufacturing where it uses xyz points. 3Dscanners always a mesh, points in space, triangles that create the visual surface. Modelling and 3D printing is usually based on a NURBS model and then converted to a MESH model for manufacturing in CAM CAD surface models are usually created using NURBS surfaces, while 3D scans are typically exported as a polygon mesh. The conversion from a polygon mesh to a NURBS model is called \u201creverse engineering\u201d. Worked by the CPU. PARAMETRIC DESIGN a process based on algorithmic thinking that allows the expression of parameters and rules that together define, codify and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response. The term comes from mathematics and refers to the use of parameters or variables that allow the final result of an equation or system to be manipulated or altered. Its time saving, can create unique and exclusive designs, its adaptable to space conditions, contributes to greater architectural and manufacturing freedom where it goes hand in hand with digital fabrication without extra cost for same amount of effort to create different shapes, all shapes can be individual, high customisation. Traditional fabrication methods can\u2019t realise the demand on this individualisation. TOPOLOGY OPTIMISATION \u00b7 Using Algorithmic Models to Create Lightweight Design \u00b7 Topology optimization (TO) is a shape optimization method that uses algorithmic models to optimize material layout within a user-defined space for a given set of loads, conditions, and constraints. TO maximizes the performance and efficiency of the design by removing redundant material from areas that do not need to carry significant loads to reduce weight or solve design challenges like reducing resonance or thermal stress. Designs produced with topology optimization often include free forms and intricate shapes that are complex or impossible to manufacture with traditional production methods. However, TO designs are a perfect match for additive manufacturing processes that have more forgiving design rules and can easily reproduce complex shapes without additional costs. GENERATIVE MODELLING Generative design is an iterative design exploration process that uses an AI-driven software program to generate a range of design solutions that meet a set of constraints. Unlike traditional design, where the process begins with a model based on an engineer\u2019s knowledge, generative design begins with design parameters and uses AI to generate the model. By modifying the design parameters in an increasingly refined feedback loop, engineers can find highly optimized and customized design solutions to a wide range of engineering challenges, such as making product components lighter, stronger, and more cost-effective. TOPOLOGY OPTIMISATION VS GENERATIVE MODELLING The start of its process requires a human engineer to create a CAD model, applying loads and constraints with project parameters in mind. The software then removes redundant material and generates a single optimized mesh-model concept ready for an engineer\u2019s evaluation. In other words, topology optimization requires a human-designed model from the outset to function, limiting the process, its outcomes, and its scale. In a way, topology optimization serves as the foundation for generative design. Generative design takes the process a step further and eliminates the need for the initial human-designed model, taking on the role of the designer based on the predefined set of constraints.

I have worked with laser cutting before, although it was a while back. Yet again there were many terms and methods I haven\u2019t known the names of or why they are used. I have used laser cutting for making patterns and stencils for moulds and prototypes. Terms & Methods CNC - Computer Numerical Control. Digital prototyping is CNC in different ways, laservutting etc ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control ) LASER Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation - a technology that works by directing the output of a high power laser through optics. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then melts, burns, evaporates or is entrained by a gas jet, leaving an edge with a high quality surface finish Digital Fabrication Input device, computer - saved file - output device - physical output CAM to CAD Plastic, wood, cardboard, fabrics, organic materials Micro processor vs microcontrollers (processor- like computer brain can freeze, controller like a button control, controlling hardware) https://www.naukri.com/learning/articles/difference-between-microprocessor-and-microcontroller/ https://www.archdaily.com/797107/50-downloadable-digital-joints-for-woodworking Nesting - there are programs that do it for you Rhino nest, fusion has it too SVG Nest Tolerance- Laser is 0.2 Slicer Fusion - Stacks and names the pieces, helps to make waffle References FabLab Lasercutting https://wiki.fablabbcn.org/Main_Page https://www.iaacblog.com/programs/courses/otf/ To put theory into practice we were to use a method to Laser cut something. I am currently working with water, where I am testing different clay modules to collect and hold water. This excercise was used to lasercut a simple form that will act as a mould for clay when drying where I am experimenting with forms in a modular system. a simple form that can be used as a mould to form clay and keep it in place while drying. I also lasercut a couple forms that we will be using as moulds for bio materials where we are creating different tableware, we chose as a group to make moulds in different forms that we could use to test different materials.From simple circular forms we can test size and material properties. This was a good reintroduction to lasercutting as it was a while ago I used it, as well as learning terms and the use of different Lasercutting machines and how they work. Therafter we were to choose a new peogram that we want to learn. I chose to work in Blender wehere I would like to learn how to create animations to compliment communication. I staretd with a simple animation of a bouncing ball to understand the program and methids that can be used, where I want to keep trying out fluids to make animations animating water flows. I want to learn to work with animations and motion graphics to compliment the communication of this terms project about water systems, showing citizens how they work and how they can be hacked, this could be an interesting option. I therafter experimented with After Effects and motion graphics, where I tried different ways of simulating water. At the moment I am playing around in the programs to learn by doing. I N P U T S & O U T P U T S 09.02.23 The second part of the week we learned about inputs and outputs, looking at different sensors, what they can do and how. We looked at how to choose a sensor for what you want to do, which was very good for a beginner in electronics. This was very interesting to look at as I am within a group working with grey water, collecting, filtering and reusing it. Smart Citizen Kits exist for measuring water quality of the ocean, a great way for citizens to collect information about their surroundings to better understand it to enable actions. Could a similar kit exist for measuring water quality in tap water or in grey water collection for reuse? Could this give citizens a better understanding of the water systems in the city? Create trust to the information about the water systems available? Or distrust, empowering through knowledge to take actions and question the systems? Another project - Clean Water AI - would also be interesting to work with and try, or could a combination of these projects create a simple way for citizens to use and understand there surroundings.. https://www.hackster.io/clean-water-ai/clean-water-ai-e40806 https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Components/Soil%20and%20water/#atlas-scientific-carrier-board https://www.demandsage.com/helium-10-alternatives/ To put theory into practice we worked with two different boards trying different inputs and outputs. The first board was to understand how to connect a LED and a button and to make the LED light up when the button is pressed. We learned that in Arduino IDE there are options with preset code which we used here choosing the option \u2018Button\u2019. We disconnected parts of the code as comments to test We then worked on a board with a Photo Cell, which is a sensor allowing to detect light, experimenting with light resistance, testing different light properties in the room to start with before connecting it to the first board to therafter sense the LED light that lights up when the button is pressed. https://learn.adafruit.com/photocells After adding pins and resistors it worked and showed light detected, although not very well, it didn\u2019t show very much difference from dark and light. We used a 100K ohm resistor as the instructions assigned, and then tested different resistor ohms we tried a 10K which didnt change the resistance, there was still not a big difference from light to dark. We then tried to change the code where instead of different values for light resistance, it would have a high and low, but this didnt work at all, so we went back to the first code we used and realised that there was information missing, where changing and updating the pinnumber made it work as we wanted. It then went from very bright to dark depending on the light in the room. When testing the light resistancy together with the LED to see how the light resistancy could read the LED when lit we had problem with our LED not working anymore, we now have to find why it isn\u2019t working before we can connect the boards. N E T W O R K I N G 22.02.23 In this class we spoke about the internet and how it can be seen as one of the most complex copying machines ever invented. Built up and used in networks, which are a set of devices connected to each other through any type of communication lines that allow the exchange of data between them. In a way it\u2019s network of devices that are copying bits from one place to another. When you access a website you\u2019re only copying a file from one computer to yours. Jeroen vaan Loon materializes a glass internet filled with smoke signals. For his latest piece \u2019an internet\u2019, the artist\u2019s motivation was a simple question: how would the internet look like if all data were temporary and ephemeral? When using the internet we have and share copies of our data all over the internet. Are we willing to share our information in that way? What happens to the world, cultures understandings of selves when information is available everywhere and all the time? Culture and ethics. We become ourselves through our local relationships, people, situations, culture, school, work - they make us think and be in a specific way. What happens when we build relationships with places and people in a larger network, we build a picture or way of being in our head, but it can be very different from how we are physically, disconnecting us from our local selves, hard to adapt to physical reality. Are people living in parallel realities through social media for example? What happens when young people see things on social media without a critical mind, believing that what they see is someones reality? Or believing that what they post is what is the important reality? The one that can be designed to look the way you prefer? People can tend to seperate things in poles, what is right and wrong, which can become very black and white. Ideas can then become very big and strong, compared to what they really are, especially as we tend to connect with people or things that reinforce what we are saying, that say that we\u2019re right, creating lots of small echo bubbles which can become a dangerous thing. Is it necessary to be connected all the time, do we need to write to someone sitting next to us? When oing so this data moves through multiple layers mving large distances before reaching the receiver. Do you really need to be always connected? Do we really need to send things all over the world to send a message? Why can\u2019t we send things locally? If we are all on the same wifi, why cant we just send data in this layer? In the class we used our Arduinos and created our own network, it was decided who was part of it and who could connect with who. 3 D M O D E L L I N G C N C - S U B S T R A C T I V E M A N U F A C T U R I N G 23.02.23 CNC milling is a manufacturing process that uses a cutting tool mounted on a rotating spindle to selectively remove material from a block of raw substrate. The workpiece is rigidly mounted to a table, and this table moves or rotates on different planes so the tool can work at many angles. Sophisticated CNC milling machines can have 5 or more axes of independent motion to make more complex shapes or to avoid having to move the workpiece to a separate machine. The axis of motion for a CNC milling machine are based on an X-Y-Z coordinate measuring system. All machinists refer to this when describing the basic movements of the mill, relative to an operator facing the machine. A standard CNC mill for example has three axes. The milling spindle represents the Z-axis, moving up and down. The X-axis is left-to-right, and the Y-axis is front-to-back. All of these movements of CNC mills rely on Computer Numeric Control, which is a computer program derived from a 3D digital file of the desired finished part. Many materials can be milled with CNC, acrylics, metal, wood as examples. It is very accurate and used to make many different products with a great finish and precision. The CNC cuts in layers creating small \u2018stairs\u2019, depending in the finish chosen, different mills would be used where the round one is used last to create a top finish. It is a tool that is accurate, fast and efficiant for production. As an assignment we were to make a piece of furniture in pairs. We had one sheet of Plywood 2400.1200.15 to share between two students. I worked together with June where we made a small stool for the classroom as the existing chairs are not made to sat for longer periods of time, they are very low, and are hard to sit on comfortably when there is a need to concentrate for long periods of time as we have many and long lectures. We wanted to create a \u2018chair\u2019 that is flat pack without the need for screws or binding. It has a boxy amusing expression, and will be painted in bright blue to add some color to the classroom. The most important for me is that the seat height is higher than the existing chairs and the possibility to sit on the front part is increased to sit better for longer periods of time at the existing tables. I N T E R F A C E \u00b7 M A C H I N E v s M A C H I N E 0 1 . 0 3 . 2 3 Today we did many of the things that we have already done in class, but this time with a very hands-on approach, by learning through doing and then reading in on what we had done. This was for me a very good way to learn and I felt like I understood what I was doing a lot more. Practically all we used was an Arduino, a bread board and a LED light, but used the LED in different ways. T H E - H A R D - C O D E D - W A Y Finding the code in Arduino IDE and using basic, here its important to change the LED to a pin so it doesn\u2019t use the LED on the Arduino. Here we changed it to LedPin 14 in all of the code and the LED blinks within the time frame put in the code of the led being on and off. We have done this in classes before, but for me this was really the first time that I understood what I was doing and how I could controll the code and the Arduino. A S K I N G - F O R - I T We can add a message and make it do what we ask it to do. I tested very simple actions by adding blink twice and blink twice slowly. I wanted to start with simple things to actually understand what I was changing in the code and how the LED acted from that. M A K I N G - I T - D O - A N I M A T I O N S We installed and used the library JLed which includes code that makes the LED act in different ways, breathe for example where it lights up slowly and fliuidly as a breathe. There are many possibilities to play with LEDs, connecting many in different light patterns for example. A S K I N G - I T - F R O M - T H E - I N T E R N E T (I and II) Last week we worked on this, but in a different way, where we made our own \u2018network\u2019 in the class and sent messages to eachother within it. What we did today was similar but for me explained in a very understandable way. MQTT trigger things or get things from sensors. The concept of MQTT is as simple as that you have a server: the MQTT broker, that can sense things. It\u2019s a big part of the internet of things IOT. Then we have publishers - sensors that could be anything, for example a computer. Then we also have subscribers that are listening to the broker and waiting for the broker to tell them what to do. M A K I N G - S E N S O R S - T O - D O - I T - R E M O T E L Y 3 D F A B R I C A T I O N & S C A N N I N G 02.03.23 https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap 3 D P R I N T I N G 3D printing is the additive process of layers to build a 3 dimensional object. The benefits with 3D printing and additive manufacturing are no or minimal waste, saving a lot of material at a low cost while being able to manufacture complex forms. It is also a great source for rapid prototyping of testing forms, shapes, durability. There are a variety of 3D printing materials, including thermoplastics such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), metals (including powders), resins, ceramics, clay and bio materials. The most common printing technology is Extrusion (FDM), but there is also Light Polymerised (SLA) and Powder bed (3DP) Layer height \u00b7 Resolution vs Time The thickness of the layer height determines the resolution of the surface. By using lower print height the resolution or finish is better but it takes longer. If printing with curvature lowering the layer height will reduce the stair effect that will become less visible. Shell Thickness Increasing thickness increases resistance. Adding number of shells will also increase printing time and material. 3D SCANNING Taking a picture of an object as 3 dimensional. Similar technologies are used in everyday products such as iPhone using scanning for faceid recognition. 3D scanning is the process of analyzing a real-world object or environment to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance (e.g. color). The collected data can then be used to construct digital 3D models. A 3D scanner can be based on many different technologies, each with its own limitations, advantages and costs. Many limitations in the kind of objects that can be digitised are still present. For example, optical technology may encounter many difficulties with dark, shiny, reflective or transparent objects. For example, industrial computed tomography scanning, structured-light 3D scanners, LiDAR and Time Of Flight 3D Scanners can be used to construct digital 3D models, without destructive testing. Collected 3D data is useful for a wide variety of applications. These devices are used extensively by the entertainment industry in the production of movies and video games, including virtual reality. Other common applications of this technology include augmented reality,[1] motion capture,[2][3] gesture recognition,[4] robotic mapping,[5] industrial design, orthotics and prosthetics,[6] reverse engineering and prototyping, quality control/inspection and the digitization of cultural artifacts.[7] (Wikipedia) As an assignment we were to 3D print something and then 3D scan it or the other way around. I 3D printed a plug that I wanted to try to connect in an existing brick and experiment with creating a water tight plug to cennect bricks while still letting water flow between them. This was therafter scanned where I used the app Polycam to test the results of scanning with a phone. I have used different 3D scanning tools before, altough a while ago, but in my work not had much need of the precision of them. I therefor wanted to try a tool that could be used without setting up lots of equipment to see if this could add some curiosity to the tool, and try and use it as a tool for experimentation and inspiration of form.","title":"Prototyping for Design"},{"location":"term2/04-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#p-r-o-t-o-t-y-p-i-n-g-f-o-r-d-e-s-i-g-n","text":"This section will be part of a weekly journal where I\u2019ll be documenting what we are doing during the course Prototyping for Design. Parts of it will be very simple documentation of the process for future use and understanding P R O T O T Y P I N G T O G E T H E R 01.02.23 Starting off the course we were reintroduced to electronics and Arduino receiving homework to create music with an ESP32 and a buzzer. Since I haven\u2019t worked with it before the one week course during the first term I will be documenting this step by step for remembering how to get started in the future. Creating music with Arduino and buzzers We used a ESP32 microcontroller, a Piezo buzzer that is an electronic component that can make sounds, beeps or play music, a bread board and connection wires and pins which are then connected through Arduino IDE and code to make sounds. There are lots of tutorials that show how to do this exercise where I followed this one for setting up the microcontroller, breadboard and buzzer. For the code I used an already existing one where I practiced creating a loop instead of the music stopping and tried different melodies. For me, this exercise was a good refresh in what we did in the first term, allowing me to in a simple exercise practice restarting Arduino IDE, where we hade to reinstall a new version, but most of all it was a good way to learn how to search for information about how to get started with projects and what to search for to find relevant information. D I G I T A L I Z I N G - R E A L I T I E S 02.02.23 Today we had a presentation about digital tools for 2D, 3D, parametric and generative deisgn. We started off by communally adding programs we have worked with in the past to a Miroboard. I have used 2D and 3D programs for modelling before such as Illustrator, Rhino, Solidworks, Grasshopper, Sketchup to create 3D and 2D models and files for digital manufacturing, where I now saw so many interesting programs and other ways of working. Although I have worked in 2D and 3D to create models and files for digital fabrication there were many terms and things I was not aware about or not complete sure of why I used, I had just learnt that that\u2019s how you do it. List Computer Aided Design (CAD) Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the foundation of digital transformation in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry. A holistic process of creating and managing information for a built asset. Based on an intelligent model and enabled by a cloud platform, BIM integrates structured, multi-disciplinary data to produce a digital representation of an asset across its lifecycle, from planning and design to construction and operations. Pixel: square in a x/y grid, smallest unit of bitmap images (called rester image or bitmap)average phone take millions of pixels in an image (GPU processed) Light data to store but heavy file. In Computer graphics, a pixel, dot, or picture element is a physical point in a picture. A pixel is simply the smallest addressable element of a picture represented on a screen. A majority of pictures that we see on our computer screen are raster images. The selfie that you click with your mobile phone is another example of a raster image. An image is made up using a collection of pixels referred to as a bitmap. Each pixel is made up of RGB sub pixels. It allows to store complex textures and gradients. It has multiple formats with a variety of compressions and processing requires less processor load. It needs a lot of RAM to store textures and uses a lot of memory. It loses quality when enlarged Bitmap: In computer graphics, a bitmap is a mapping from some domain (for example, a range of integers) to bits, that is, values which are zero or one. It is also called a bit array or bitmap index. The more general term pixmap refers to a map of pixels, where each one may store more than two colors, thus using more than one bit per pixel. Often bitmap is used for this as well. In some contexts, the term bitmap implies one bit per pixel, while pixmap is used for images with multiple bits per pixel. Raster - Raster images use bit maps to store information. This means a large file needs a large bitmap. The larger the image, the more disk space the image file will take up. As an example, a 640 x 480 image requires information to be stored for 307,200 pixels, while a 3072 x 2048 image (from a 6.3 Megapixel digital camera) needs to store information for a whopping 6,291,456 pixels. We use algorithms that compress images to help reduce these file sizes. Image formats like jpeg and gif are common compressed image formats. Scaling down these images is easy but enlarging a bitmap makes it pixelated or simply blurred. Hence for images that need to scale to different sizes, we use vector graphics. File extensions: .BMP, .TIF, .GIF, .JPG Vector - The geometrical (mathematical) description of an image. It can be enlarged as many times as you want without losing quality and allows for easy editing and changes. It is also lighter than pixel format images. Making use of sequential commands or mathematical statements or programs which place lines or shapes in a 2-D or 3-D environment is referred to as Vector Graphics. Vector graphics are best for printing since it is composed of a series of mathematical curves. As a result vector graphics print crisply even when they are enlarged. In physics: A vector is something that has a magnitude and direction. In vector graphics, the file is created and saved as a sequence of vector statements. Rather than having a bit in the file for each bit of line drawing, we use commands which describe a series of points to be connected. As a result, a much smaller file is obtained. The cons with vector formats are that they don\u2019t store texture and don\u2019t allow complex gradients as in photography. File extensions: SVG, EPS, PDF, AI, DXF Basics of a computer \u00b7 CPU \u00b7 Vector. heavy mathematical equations \u00b7 Constructed from millions of transistors, the CPU can have multiple processing cores and is commonly referred to as the brain of the computer. It is essential to all modern computing systems as it executes the commands and processes needed for your computer and operating system. The CPU is also important in determining how fast programs can run, from surfing the web to building spreadsheets. GPU \u00b7 Graphic Processing Unit \u00b7 Raster. The GPU is a processor that is made up of many smaller and more specialized cores. By working together, the cores deliver massive performance when a processing task can be divided up and processed across many cores. RGB stands for red, green and blue. RGB uses light to produce color: the more illuminated light involved, the lighter the image. RGB produces the widest range of color. RGB colors are typically used on computer monitors, digital cameras and televisions \u2014 any device that uses light to produce an image. CMYK stands for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. This category of color uses the combination of ink pigments to produce color. The less ink used, the lighter the image; the more ink used, the darker the image. Printing projects typically use the CMYK color category. sRGB (storeRGB) Color utility, mainly used on internet, save as this when uploading. It has less cooler rendering and shouldn\u2019t be used for printing. Resolution is the product of width and height of a digital image expressed in pixels. How many pixels and the density are measured in pixels per inch (PPI) and are what determine the quality of an image 72 PPI used on the Internet 300 PPI high resolution image 320 PPI average of what a human eye can see 600 PPI are used in professional printers Phone screens today have normally around 400-600 pixel, some 900. can\u2019t see the difference, marketing sales point FILE FORMATS JPEG file compressing, loses quality for every time its opened PNG compression less - heavier image, but doesn\u2019t lose quality MESH // NURBS NURBS model consists of points connected by curves. (freeform modeling, fluid shapes with a lot of complexity, at the same time being easy to modify.) Its a mathematical model used in computer graphics to generate curves and surfaces. It generates a precise geometry with smooth surfaces with geometries that are mathematically defined using control points that create complex curves to form surfaces around them. Used by many 3D scans and is ideal for CAD based programs as it is more accurate, takes less space and is easy to translate to different programs. MESH, GPU - A collection of verticles, edges and faces as a structural construction of a 3D model consisting of triangles, quadrilateral or other polygons. 3D meshes use reference points of x,y, z axes to define shapes with width, height and depth. Object smoothness is achieved by increasing the number of polygons within a model, this also affects the filesize making it very heavy. Not good for scaling as the polygons increase or decrease in size while scaling affecting the surface and form. STL file for manufacturing where it uses xyz points. 3Dscanners always a mesh, points in space, triangles that create the visual surface. Modelling and 3D printing is usually based on a NURBS model and then converted to a MESH model for manufacturing in CAM CAD surface models are usually created using NURBS surfaces, while 3D scans are typically exported as a polygon mesh. The conversion from a polygon mesh to a NURBS model is called \u201creverse engineering\u201d. Worked by the CPU. PARAMETRIC DESIGN a process based on algorithmic thinking that allows the expression of parameters and rules that together define, codify and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response. The term comes from mathematics and refers to the use of parameters or variables that allow the final result of an equation or system to be manipulated or altered. Its time saving, can create unique and exclusive designs, its adaptable to space conditions, contributes to greater architectural and manufacturing freedom where it goes hand in hand with digital fabrication without extra cost for same amount of effort to create different shapes, all shapes can be individual, high customisation. Traditional fabrication methods can\u2019t realise the demand on this individualisation. TOPOLOGY OPTIMISATION \u00b7 Using Algorithmic Models to Create Lightweight Design \u00b7 Topology optimization (TO) is a shape optimization method that uses algorithmic models to optimize material layout within a user-defined space for a given set of loads, conditions, and constraints. TO maximizes the performance and efficiency of the design by removing redundant material from areas that do not need to carry significant loads to reduce weight or solve design challenges like reducing resonance or thermal stress. Designs produced with topology optimization often include free forms and intricate shapes that are complex or impossible to manufacture with traditional production methods. However, TO designs are a perfect match for additive manufacturing processes that have more forgiving design rules and can easily reproduce complex shapes without additional costs. GENERATIVE MODELLING Generative design is an iterative design exploration process that uses an AI-driven software program to generate a range of design solutions that meet a set of constraints. Unlike traditional design, where the process begins with a model based on an engineer\u2019s knowledge, generative design begins with design parameters and uses AI to generate the model. By modifying the design parameters in an increasingly refined feedback loop, engineers can find highly optimized and customized design solutions to a wide range of engineering challenges, such as making product components lighter, stronger, and more cost-effective. TOPOLOGY OPTIMISATION VS GENERATIVE MODELLING The start of its process requires a human engineer to create a CAD model, applying loads and constraints with project parameters in mind. The software then removes redundant material and generates a single optimized mesh-model concept ready for an engineer\u2019s evaluation. In other words, topology optimization requires a human-designed model from the outset to function, limiting the process, its outcomes, and its scale. In a way, topology optimization serves as the foundation for generative design. Generative design takes the process a step further and eliminates the need for the initial human-designed model, taking on the role of the designer based on the predefined set of constraints.

I have worked with laser cutting before, although it was a while back. Yet again there were many terms and methods I haven\u2019t known the names of or why they are used. I have used laser cutting for making patterns and stencils for moulds and prototypes. Terms & Methods CNC - Computer Numerical Control. Digital prototyping is CNC in different ways, laservutting etc ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_control ) LASER Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation - a technology that works by directing the output of a high power laser through optics. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then melts, burns, evaporates or is entrained by a gas jet, leaving an edge with a high quality surface finish Digital Fabrication Input device, computer - saved file - output device - physical output CAM to CAD Plastic, wood, cardboard, fabrics, organic materials Micro processor vs microcontrollers (processor- like computer brain can freeze, controller like a button control, controlling hardware) https://www.naukri.com/learning/articles/difference-between-microprocessor-and-microcontroller/ https://www.archdaily.com/797107/50-downloadable-digital-joints-for-woodworking Nesting - there are programs that do it for you Rhino nest, fusion has it too SVG Nest Tolerance- Laser is 0.2 Slicer Fusion - Stacks and names the pieces, helps to make waffle References FabLab Lasercutting https://wiki.fablabbcn.org/Main_Page https://www.iaacblog.com/programs/courses/otf/ To put theory into practice we were to use a method to Laser cut something. I am currently working with water, where I am testing different clay modules to collect and hold water. This excercise was used to lasercut a simple form that will act as a mould for clay when drying where I am experimenting with forms in a modular system. a simple form that can be used as a mould to form clay and keep it in place while drying. I also lasercut a couple forms that we will be using as moulds for bio materials where we are creating different tableware, we chose as a group to make moulds in different forms that we could use to test different materials.From simple circular forms we can test size and material properties. This was a good reintroduction to lasercutting as it was a while ago I used it, as well as learning terms and the use of different Lasercutting machines and how they work. Therafter we were to choose a new peogram that we want to learn. I chose to work in Blender wehere I would like to learn how to create animations to compliment communication. I staretd with a simple animation of a bouncing ball to understand the program and methids that can be used, where I want to keep trying out fluids to make animations animating water flows. I want to learn to work with animations and motion graphics to compliment the communication of this terms project about water systems, showing citizens how they work and how they can be hacked, this could be an interesting option. I therafter experimented with After Effects and motion graphics, where I tried different ways of simulating water. At the moment I am playing around in the programs to learn by doing. I N P U T S & O U T P U T S 09.02.23 The second part of the week we learned about inputs and outputs, looking at different sensors, what they can do and how. We looked at how to choose a sensor for what you want to do, which was very good for a beginner in electronics. This was very interesting to look at as I am within a group working with grey water, collecting, filtering and reusing it. Smart Citizen Kits exist for measuring water quality of the ocean, a great way for citizens to collect information about their surroundings to better understand it to enable actions. Could a similar kit exist for measuring water quality in tap water or in grey water collection for reuse? Could this give citizens a better understanding of the water systems in the city? Create trust to the information about the water systems available? Or distrust, empowering through knowledge to take actions and question the systems? Another project - Clean Water AI - would also be interesting to work with and try, or could a combination of these projects create a simple way for citizens to use and understand there surroundings.. https://www.hackster.io/clean-water-ai/clean-water-ai-e40806 https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Components/Soil%20and%20water/#atlas-scientific-carrier-board https://www.demandsage.com/helium-10-alternatives/ To put theory into practice we worked with two different boards trying different inputs and outputs. The first board was to understand how to connect a LED and a button and to make the LED light up when the button is pressed. We learned that in Arduino IDE there are options with preset code which we used here choosing the option \u2018Button\u2019. We disconnected parts of the code as comments to test We then worked on a board with a Photo Cell, which is a sensor allowing to detect light, experimenting with light resistance, testing different light properties in the room to start with before connecting it to the first board to therafter sense the LED light that lights up when the button is pressed. https://learn.adafruit.com/photocells After adding pins and resistors it worked and showed light detected, although not very well, it didn\u2019t show very much difference from dark and light. We used a 100K ohm resistor as the instructions assigned, and then tested different resistor ohms we tried a 10K which didnt change the resistance, there was still not a big difference from light to dark. We then tried to change the code where instead of different values for light resistance, it would have a high and low, but this didnt work at all, so we went back to the first code we used and realised that there was information missing, where changing and updating the pinnumber made it work as we wanted. It then went from very bright to dark depending on the light in the room. When testing the light resistancy together with the LED to see how the light resistancy could read the LED when lit we had problem with our LED not working anymore, we now have to find why it isn\u2019t working before we can connect the boards. N E T W O R K I N G 22.02.23 In this class we spoke about the internet and how it can be seen as one of the most complex copying machines ever invented. Built up and used in networks, which are a set of devices connected to each other through any type of communication lines that allow the exchange of data between them. In a way it\u2019s network of devices that are copying bits from one place to another. When you access a website you\u2019re only copying a file from one computer to yours. Jeroen vaan Loon materializes a glass internet filled with smoke signals. For his latest piece \u2019an internet\u2019, the artist\u2019s motivation was a simple question: how would the internet look like if all data were temporary and ephemeral? When using the internet we have and share copies of our data all over the internet. Are we willing to share our information in that way? What happens to the world, cultures understandings of selves when information is available everywhere and all the time? Culture and ethics. We become ourselves through our local relationships, people, situations, culture, school, work - they make us think and be in a specific way. What happens when we build relationships with places and people in a larger network, we build a picture or way of being in our head, but it can be very different from how we are physically, disconnecting us from our local selves, hard to adapt to physical reality. Are people living in parallel realities through social media for example? What happens when young people see things on social media without a critical mind, believing that what they see is someones reality? Or believing that what they post is what is the important reality? The one that can be designed to look the way you prefer? People can tend to seperate things in poles, what is right and wrong, which can become very black and white. Ideas can then become very big and strong, compared to what they really are, especially as we tend to connect with people or things that reinforce what we are saying, that say that we\u2019re right, creating lots of small echo bubbles which can become a dangerous thing. Is it necessary to be connected all the time, do we need to write to someone sitting next to us? When oing so this data moves through multiple layers mving large distances before reaching the receiver. Do you really need to be always connected? Do we really need to send things all over the world to send a message? Why can\u2019t we send things locally? If we are all on the same wifi, why cant we just send data in this layer? In the class we used our Arduinos and created our own network, it was decided who was part of it and who could connect with who. 3 D M O D E L L I N G C N C - S U B S T R A C T I V E M A N U F A C T U R I N G 23.02.23 CNC milling is a manufacturing process that uses a cutting tool mounted on a rotating spindle to selectively remove material from a block of raw substrate. The workpiece is rigidly mounted to a table, and this table moves or rotates on different planes so the tool can work at many angles. Sophisticated CNC milling machines can have 5 or more axes of independent motion to make more complex shapes or to avoid having to move the workpiece to a separate machine. The axis of motion for a CNC milling machine are based on an X-Y-Z coordinate measuring system. All machinists refer to this when describing the basic movements of the mill, relative to an operator facing the machine. A standard CNC mill for example has three axes. The milling spindle represents the Z-axis, moving up and down. The X-axis is left-to-right, and the Y-axis is front-to-back. All of these movements of CNC mills rely on Computer Numeric Control, which is a computer program derived from a 3D digital file of the desired finished part. Many materials can be milled with CNC, acrylics, metal, wood as examples. It is very accurate and used to make many different products with a great finish and precision. The CNC cuts in layers creating small \u2018stairs\u2019, depending in the finish chosen, different mills would be used where the round one is used last to create a top finish. It is a tool that is accurate, fast and efficiant for production. As an assignment we were to make a piece of furniture in pairs. We had one sheet of Plywood 2400.1200.15 to share between two students. I worked together with June where we made a small stool for the classroom as the existing chairs are not made to sat for longer periods of time, they are very low, and are hard to sit on comfortably when there is a need to concentrate for long periods of time as we have many and long lectures. We wanted to create a \u2018chair\u2019 that is flat pack without the need for screws or binding. It has a boxy amusing expression, and will be painted in bright blue to add some color to the classroom. The most important for me is that the seat height is higher than the existing chairs and the possibility to sit on the front part is increased to sit better for longer periods of time at the existing tables. I N T E R F A C E \u00b7 M A C H I N E v s M A C H I N E 0 1 . 0 3 . 2 3 Today we did many of the things that we have already done in class, but this time with a very hands-on approach, by learning through doing and then reading in on what we had done. This was for me a very good way to learn and I felt like I understood what I was doing a lot more. Practically all we used was an Arduino, a bread board and a LED light, but used the LED in different ways. T H E - H A R D - C O D E D - W A Y Finding the code in Arduino IDE and using basic, here its important to change the LED to a pin so it doesn\u2019t use the LED on the Arduino. Here we changed it to LedPin 14 in all of the code and the LED blinks within the time frame put in the code of the led being on and off. We have done this in classes before, but for me this was really the first time that I understood what I was doing and how I could controll the code and the Arduino. A S K I N G - F O R - I T We can add a message and make it do what we ask it to do. I tested very simple actions by adding blink twice and blink twice slowly. I wanted to start with simple things to actually understand what I was changing in the code and how the LED acted from that. M A K I N G - I T - D O - A N I M A T I O N S We installed and used the library JLed which includes code that makes the LED act in different ways, breathe for example where it lights up slowly and fliuidly as a breathe. There are many possibilities to play with LEDs, connecting many in different light patterns for example. A S K I N G - I T - F R O M - T H E - I N T E R N E T (I and II) Last week we worked on this, but in a different way, where we made our own \u2018network\u2019 in the class and sent messages to eachother within it. What we did today was similar but for me explained in a very understandable way. MQTT trigger things or get things from sensors. The concept of MQTT is as simple as that you have a server: the MQTT broker, that can sense things. It\u2019s a big part of the internet of things IOT. Then we have publishers - sensors that could be anything, for example a computer. Then we also have subscribers that are listening to the broker and waiting for the broker to tell them what to do. M A K I N G - S E N S O R S - T O - D O - I T - R E M O T E L Y 3 D F A B R I C A T I O N & S C A N N I N G 02.03.23 https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap 3 D P R I N T I N G 3D printing is the additive process of layers to build a 3 dimensional object. The benefits with 3D printing and additive manufacturing are no or minimal waste, saving a lot of material at a low cost while being able to manufacture complex forms. It is also a great source for rapid prototyping of testing forms, shapes, durability. There are a variety of 3D printing materials, including thermoplastics such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), metals (including powders), resins, ceramics, clay and bio materials. The most common printing technology is Extrusion (FDM), but there is also Light Polymerised (SLA) and Powder bed (3DP) Layer height \u00b7 Resolution vs Time The thickness of the layer height determines the resolution of the surface. By using lower print height the resolution or finish is better but it takes longer. If printing with curvature lowering the layer height will reduce the stair effect that will become less visible. Shell Thickness Increasing thickness increases resistance. Adding number of shells will also increase printing time and material. 3D SCANNING Taking a picture of an object as 3 dimensional. Similar technologies are used in everyday products such as iPhone using scanning for faceid recognition. 3D scanning is the process of analyzing a real-world object or environment to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance (e.g. color). The collected data can then be used to construct digital 3D models. A 3D scanner can be based on many different technologies, each with its own limitations, advantages and costs. Many limitations in the kind of objects that can be digitised are still present. For example, optical technology may encounter many difficulties with dark, shiny, reflective or transparent objects. For example, industrial computed tomography scanning, structured-light 3D scanners, LiDAR and Time Of Flight 3D Scanners can be used to construct digital 3D models, without destructive testing. Collected 3D data is useful for a wide variety of applications. These devices are used extensively by the entertainment industry in the production of movies and video games, including virtual reality. Other common applications of this technology include augmented reality,[1] motion capture,[2][3] gesture recognition,[4] robotic mapping,[5] industrial design, orthotics and prosthetics,[6] reverse engineering and prototyping, quality control/inspection and the digitization of cultural artifacts.[7] (Wikipedia) As an assignment we were to 3D print something and then 3D scan it or the other way around. I 3D printed a plug that I wanted to try to connect in an existing brick and experiment with creating a water tight plug to cennect bricks while still letting water flow between them. This was therafter scanned where I used the app Polycam to test the results of scanning with a phone. I have used different 3D scanning tools before, altough a while ago, but in my work not had much need of the precision of them. I therefor wanted to try a tool that could be used without setting up lots of equipment to see if this could add some curiosity to the tool, and try and use it as a tool for experimentation and inspiration of form.","title":"P R O T O T Y P I N G - F O R - D E S I G N"},{"location":"term2/05-Micro%20Challenge%20I/","text":"M I C R O C H A L L E N G E \u00b7 I \u00b6 Cagsun Acemoglu \u00b7 Josephine Bourghardt \u00b7 Korbi Nida-Rumelin \u00b7 Ramiro Arganaraz These are my personal reflection and notes from the first Micro Challenge. PROJECT \u00b6 How can we rethink the relationship we have with water? Can a first person perspective of using your own grey water act as behavioural change in our relationship with water? Can a modular grey water collection system create respect for the resource that holds life? With water as the main substance it can provide isolation and allow life to flourish, housing plants and other species, allowing the transfer of materials, filtering them where needed, and optimising energy usage by decreasing water consumption of fresh resources and waste water collection and management, Can a simple \u2018water brick\u2019 create a future where a modular wall of water collection that adapts and transforms depending on needs become standard in homes? Can making vertical gardening, growing your own food, and water accessible to people in urban environments where it is typical that space is an issue? WHAT We are aiming to create an open source modular system for citizens to collect and reuse grey water in the living space where creating awareness of water systems and what you flush down the drain, knowledge of saving and reusing grey water can help conserve fresh water resources, reduce strain on municipal water treatment systems, as well as reduce the amount of wastewater released into the environment. Integrating grey water storage systems in apartments has the potential to greatly impact urban water systems by improving water management, conserving resources, and making cities more sustainable. Grey water is the wastewater generated from sources such as sinks, showers, and washing machines. If collected and treated properly, grey water can be safely reused for non-potable purposes, such as flushing toilets, watering plants, and cleaning. HOW An artefact that monitor (and communicates) water quality for growing plants in an urban environment. It will be modular, with a system of water containers based on waste materials that is compatible with a larger water system project. In prototyping we will use Arduino\u2019s together with sensors (that are readily available, cheap, simple, etc) and perhaps use a laser cut structure to hold the testing kit and basic water containers. A kit that can be used in further research of grey water collection and reuse systems in urban environments. Testing to understand water quality after different filtering, what quality is needed / acceptable to be used for watering plants, what is the quality of the water after plant filtration. For citizen use.. understand water systems around you, making data/ information available WHY Allowing citizens to measure their own water quality could help to increase awareness and engagement with water conservation and management efforts. There are several benefits to allowing citizens to test their own water quality, including increased awareness, empowerment, cost savings, improved water management, and increased trust. By testing their own water quality, citizens can learn about the quality of the water they are using and the presence of any contaminants. This increased awareness can lead to greater understanding of the importance of water conservation and the need to protect this precious resource. It can also allow for citizens to take an active role in monitoring and improving the quality of their water supply. This sense of empowerment can lead to greater engagement and support for water management and conservation initiatives. It can potentially save money by identifying and addressing any water quality problems before they become more serious and costly to fix. By testing your own water quality, citizens can provide valuable data to water management agencies, helping them to make more informed decisions about water treatment and distribution. This can lead to improved water management and better protection of public health, which could also result in an increased trust in water management agencies, as they can see that their water is being monitored and tested on a regular basis. We wanted to understand what measuring water quality could actually mean and what measurements that are valuable in different situations. During this Micro Challenge we wanted to create an artefact that can be used as a resource throughout the term. We proceeded in looking into what to measure and what type of quality of water that matters to outcome. To start off we will be using sensors and Arduino to measure parameters in water quality that are important to plants, potted or for example in a hydroponic system. Some of the important parameters are PH Value, Temperature and Conductivity. How could these sensors become part of a system in our further process and interventions to measure water quality? SENSORS FOR MEASURING WATER QUALITY TEMPERATURE One Wire Temperature Sensor - DS18B20 https://www.seeedstudio.com/One-Wire-Temperature-Sensor-p-1235.html Temperature testing is the process of measuring temperature levels in water. Temperature is a key factor in water chemistry. Temperature affects the dissolved oxygen levels in water, the rate of photosynthesis, metabolic rates of organisms, etc. Aquatic organisms depend on particular temperature ranges for their health. Each species thrives in a specific temperature range, and many animals use temperature as a signal for when to reproduce and when to migrate. If there is an abnormality in temperature this can disrupt the balance of aquatic ecosystems with devastating effect. Water temperature also impacts water density; differences in water temperature and density can cause stratification. https://www.aquaread.com/sensors/temperature PH PH sensors play a very important role in water quality and water treatment. One of the most important indicators of water quality test is its pH. pH and conductivity are key parameters for measuring the pH of a substance while monitoring the level of nutrients, salts or impurities present. pH and conductivity measurements are used in a variety of applications, including industrial water and wastewater treatment, boiler maintenance and agriculture, as well as aquariums and aquaculture. Hydrogen potential or \u201cpH\u201d is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a sample and is used to determine the acidity or alkalinity of a product. pH values range from 0-14, with 0 being acidic, 7 being neutral and 14 being basic. Water quality depends on the proper pH value. For example, in acidic water, toxic heavy metals dissolve easily and are more harmful to organisms. pH levels also affect the availability of essential plant nutrients, with many nutrients less available at pH levels above 7. The pH electrode consists of a reference electrode, a reference solution, a reference fluid connection and a glass bulb with a hydrated gel layer. Once the electrode is immersed in the sample, a current is generated and the charge of the reference solution inside the bulb is measured compared to the solution on the outside of the gel layer. The result is a pH measurement. https://wiki.dfrobot.com/Gravity__Analog_pH_Sensor_Meter_Kit_V2_SKU_SEN0161-V2 CONDUCTIVITY Conductivity is a measurement of the concentration of ions present in a sample. It is calculated by the ability of a substance to transmit an electric current in a defined area. Conductivity is measured in units called Siemens (S) (e.g. milliSiemens per centimetre mS/cm or microSiemens per centimetre \u03bcS/cm). Conductivity is measured by conductance between two or four electrodes using the current method or potentiometric method. When the electrodes are immersed in the sample, the electrodes cause a current to pass through the sample solution. The relative concentration of ions in the solution will determine the conductivity or resistivity of the sample. The conductivity is expressed in Siemens units. 2 electrode probes (amperometers) \u2013 they work through two electrodes that are isolated from each other. Made of non-reactive materials and constructed so that both will be in contact with the sample at the same time. These two electrodes pass current through the sample at a specific frequency, the more ions present, the higher the EC reading. 4 Electrode Probe (Potentiometer) \u2013 The electrode body has four platinum rings. The top and bottom rings (on the outside) apply AC voltage to the sam planned and executed the project. We used these specific sensors as they were available in the FabLab. It took longer to calibrate the sensors than we expected. The project also quickly became very technical, where we from the start spoke about \u2018hacking\u2019 these sensors and making our own, mostly to play around with them and use the microchallenge to understand water quality from different sources and how different simple filters could effect the quality. When the project took this turn and became very technical it also played a roll in how the overall design and project proceeded within the water collection tool part. As the sensors became a central part of the design and the time it takes to calibrate, understand the software and code, it was hard to use them to also understand how they could be integrated into a system, or how to design something where they could be a part of a system. TOOL How can we create a tool that holds the sensors we need in place and lets water pass through to measure the flow? We wanted to learn more about sensors, how they work and what they show and to create a system where we could use this information in different stages of a water system. During this term we are working with water in different ways, testing filters and modular systems to collect an reuse grey water. For this it was important that we could use the sensors in different places, size of container and that in the end it could be used to learn more about how it could be fit into a bigger system. We therefor used part of a standard 63 mm PVC transparent pipe that could possibly in the future be used in a pipe system, or at least at this point illustrate what it could look like, even though eventually in a smaller scale. To hold the sensors in place to measure parameters in flowing water we used a standard PVC transparent 63mm pipe, and laser cut pieces to create caps holding water tubes and sensors in place. The caps can be removed and pieces can be changed to add other parts for future use of measuring different quality parameters of water or changing tubes of water flow. Each cap consists of 5 laser cut 5 mm acrylic pieces that hold a rubber ring to water seal and are held together with a screw. The tubes that will supply and release the pipe with water are fastened through the pre-cut holes and with hot silicone glue. The same is for the cap with sensors. SYSTEM This measurement tool is then connected to a water resource where water is pushed into the tool with a pump until it is full, where it can stay to be measured before it it released from an output tube under. By using this method we can measure quality of flowing water from different places in a modular setting, as well as part of a bigger flowing system. For the full documentation of how it was made and what materials and resources that were used follow the link to our main page where Korbi and I worked mainly on the manufacturing part. https://hackmd.io/@Kgea_wTSQ1i-eiGs2APlag/HJ5MJ6sTj REFLECTION The measurement tool that we created during the first Micro Challenge became a more technical project than I had expected and I think that I would have preferred engaging more with making or hacking these sensors in a DIY version to then also spend time on understanding how and where they could be used to be useful for the process of this terms projects. Aside from this it was an interesting learning process and a good re introduction to using the machines in the lab, here specifically the Laser cutter. It was also a good insight to how existing sensors work and a reminder of the time it takes to calibrate and function them together with each other and systems. The project was also for me a good reminder of that I have to keep my roll in the project, which was during this project product development where Korbi and I worked on the artefact, how it could be assembled and used and specifically how it could be water tight. The part of creating a watertight piece was for me the most interesting part, as it will be important further on on the project I\u2019m working on. We learned how Fab Lab has worked on a 3D Paste Printer for Bio materials and worked from the same method of using rubber rings in a custom cap for a tube. This knowledge can be very useful for further parts of this term. I realised, that I, during the progress of the artefact lost track of what it was for and how we wanted to use it, when all the existing sensors that we could use from the Fab Lab and electronics became a part of it. In the process of trying to understand this and how all the electronics and sensors worked, it slowed down my creative process and making decisions take longer than needed, which will be something I\u2019m going to remember for next time.","title":"Micro Challenge I"},{"location":"term2/05-Micro%20Challenge%20I/#m-i-c-r-o-c-h-a-l-l-e-n-g-e-i","text":"Cagsun Acemoglu \u00b7 Josephine Bourghardt \u00b7 Korbi Nida-Rumelin \u00b7 Ramiro Arganaraz These are my personal reflection and notes from the first Micro Challenge.","title":"M I C R O   C H A L L E N G E  \u00b7 I"},{"location":"term2/05-Micro%20Challenge%20I/#project","text":"How can we rethink the relationship we have with water?

Making sense of the world is a part of human nature, and we do this in many different ways, through words and symbols, through artefacts and spaces, through body language, thinking, doing, feeling. By making sense of our surroundings we search for a meaning to be a part of them, to exist with and within them. We do this in different ways and see things from different perspectives that become interrelated and we make sense and meaning of the world together. Without others I don\u2019t believe there would be much meaning of even trying to find meaning. We are connected to other people and the world around us, it is a collaborative process of many understanding each other and the world around us, so I have also chosen to do this in a collaborative manner From the many lectures we have had we\u2019ve spoke n about design from different perspectives and In the words of Brian Cox, \u201cMeaning is a property of intelligence.\u201d This statement implies that as intelligent beings, we have the ability to assign meaning to the world around us. The cognitive psychologists Robert R. Hoffman, Gary Klein, and Brian M. Moon define sensemaking as \u201ca motivated, continuous effort to understand connections in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively\u201d (Kolko, 2010). Coming from a background in design I recognise the process of sensemaking as part of the design process to identify and forge connections to make meaning out of data through interpretation and form. To constantly search for patterns and relationships and understand the current or past connections in order to anticipate future trajectories and act accordingly. This process of making sense through finding and connecting different patterns and relationships are what I have valued and what I feel good at, but the space I have been acting on this started to at some point lose meaning. I have a background in product and furniture design and although the impact these products have on peoples lives are on daily basis and can affect health and the environment for the better, I felt stuck in a narrow alley of being in a space that was too small for the questions I had about the world around me and the impact of the things I made. \u2018As designers, we have the power to shape the world around us through the decisions we make and the actions we take. Whether it is the design of an object or the design of a system, our choices have far-reaching consequences.\u2019 - Tomas Diez, educational Notion During the past couple of years I have tried to make sense of where I place myself in this world and how I would like to use my skills and efforts to take active actions that benefit the more, to create meaning for myself in what I do and create meaning for and with others with what I do. It was the quest to find meaning that led me to become a designer, to solve problems through creative solutions to improve the quality of life for people and the planet. A journey of zooming in and out to understand in what context I should place myself, where I can be the most useful and how to embody this. Choices were made from different opportunities that arose in this search of making a meaningful life for myself in what I do and for others with what I can do, and the further I get in this search the more I understand that it will keep evolving through new connections of people places and actions. Quoting Chat GPT \u2018design has the potential to make a positive impact on society and the environment by creating solutions that address pressing issues, improving user experience, promoting sustainability, fostering social inclusion, and spreading awareness, design can reconfigure systems of extraction by utilising principles such as: circular economy: designing for resource conservation and waste reduction, biomimicry: emulating nature\u2019s systems and processes for sustainable resource use, decentralisation: shifting control and ownership of resources away from centralised entities, collaborative governance: involving all stakeholders in decision-making to ensure equitable distribution of resources, innovation: creating new technologies and systems that enable sustainable extraction practices\u2019. I agree with this statement and it aligns with how I would describe design, but to add to this design is based on action and learning by doing, a channel to communicate and visualise difficult topics and alternative realities, creating an experience for others to understand. \u2018Design is not just about aesthetics or proportions, it is also about the attitude we have towards the world and the choices we make. The meaning and purpose in design are personal perceptions that translate into actions. However, it is important to remember that these actions also have a collective impact and require a coordinated effort at multiple scales.\u2019 - Tomas Diez, educational Notion As quoted in the previous paragraph the actions we take have far- reaching consequences and a collective impact, and thus my perception of what design is and the scale that I have been working in has changed leading me into a space of broad and interdisciplinary questions of the world we are living in and what world we want to live in. It is an uncomfortable situation of being in an unknown space, feeling lost in where I want to go and where I could be useful. A feeling that origins from constant questioning of oneself and the world around us. A space that I can literally say that I am constantly searching and moving towards as I also deep down believe that when in unease and completely out of the comfort zone we have a greater ability to make changes. At the moment I am studying the second term of MDEF and I have during these two terms tried to work hard on accepting and embracing this feeling of lostness instead of trying to dismiss, analyse or \u2018solve\u2019 it. According to Dr. Akomolafe the first step toward emancipatory wholeness is finding comfort in the unknowable, and embracing bewilderment and wonder (Atmos, 2023). I would say that it is easier said than done, we are still living in a world where we are constantly met with pressures to achieve more, act faster and be better, so how is that done when you have a feeling that you don\u2019t know what you are doing? How do you learn and lead in times of disruption when you cannot rely on the experiences of the past? A question posed by Otto Scharmer about 20 years ago and resulted in the method and framework for the U Theory. It is an awareness-based method for changing systems blending systems thinking, innovation, and leading change from the viewpoint of an evolving human consciousness. It draws attention to the invisible source dimension of the social field, to the quality of relationships that we have to each other, to the system, and to ourselves. The theory is visualised as a U where we start at the top of the U and as we move down one side of the U we allow ourselves to connect to the world that is outside of our institutional bubble. When at the bottom of the U, we can connect to the world that emerges from within. This space requires us to drop everything that isn\u2019t essential where the process of letting-go of our selves as we have been and are establishes a subtle connection to a deeper source of knowing before moving up the other side of the U as a better future self. The essence of presencing is that these two selves\u2014our current self and our best future Self\u2014meet at the bottom of the U and begin to listen and resonate with each other. When this subtle threshold is crossed, nothing remains the same and you begin to operate with a heightened level of energy and sense of future possibilities that could begin to function as an intentional vehicle for an emerging future (Sharmer, 2022). The past year leading up to joining the Master in Design for Emergent Futures has been a path leading to the bottom of the U and I can feel how my two selves are connecting, creating this feeling of lostness when my outer and inner self are debating. This does although mean that I am moving forward and it helped me to understand what Dr. Akomolafe means with finding comfort in the unknown and embracing it. My journey will keep moving by doing and acting towards becoming a one with what I do and with who to move towards the other side of the U. In a time of environmental, social and personal uncertainty I will do this by slowing down, not in speed but in awareness or presence, to listen to my inner self that I can hear has something to say about my outyerself and what I am doing. \u2018To slow down is to hack the machine, like we\u2019re taking on other forms of body that allow us to penetrate into different kinds of realities\u2014other worlds\u2019 as Dr Akomolafe says (Atmos, 2023). We need to work together as one for regenerative design and futures. https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org/framework The Inner Development Goals (IDGs) is a not for profit and open source initiative.

I have a background in product and furniture design and although the impact these products have on peoples lives are on daily basis and can affect health and the environment for the better, I felt stuck in a narrow alley of being in a space that was too small for the questions I had about the world around me and the impact of the things I made. \u2018As designers, we have the power to shape the world around us through the decisions we make and the actions we take. Whether it is the design of an object or the design of a system, our choices have far-reaching consequences.\u2019 - Tomas Diez, educational Notion During the past couple of years I have tried to make sense of where I place myself in this world and how I would like to use my skills and efforts to take active actions that benefit the more, to create meaning for myself in what I do and create meaning for and with others with what I do. It was the quest to find meaning that led me to become a designer, to solve problems through creative solutions to improve the quality of life for people and the planet. A journey of zooming in and out to understand in what context I should place myself, where I can be the most useful and how to embody this. Choices were made from different opportunities that arose in this search of making a meaningful life for myself in what I do and for others with what I can do, and the further I get in this search the more I understand that it will keep evolving through new connections of people places and actions. Quoting Chat GPT \u2018design has the potential to make a positive impact on society and the environment by creating solutions that address pressing issues, improving user experience, promoting sustainability, fostering social inclusion, and spreading awareness, design can reconfigure systems of extraction by utilising principles such as: circular economy: designing for resource conservation and waste reduction, biomimicry: emulating nature\u2019s systems and processes for sustainable resource use, decentralisation: shifting control and ownership of resources away from centralised entities, collaborative governance: involving all stakeholders in decision-making to ensure equitable distribution of resources, innovation: creating new technologies and systems that enable sustainable extraction practices\u2019. I agree with this statement and it aligns with how I would describe design, but to add to this design is based on action and learning by doing, a channel to communicate and visualise difficult topics and alternative realities, creating an experience for others to understand. \u2018Design is not just about aesthetics or proportions, it is also about the attitude we have towards the world and the choices we make. The meaning and purpose in design are personal perceptions that translate into actions. However, it is important to remember that these actions also have a collective impact and require a coordinated effort at multiple scales.\u2019 - Tomas Diez, educational Notion As quoted in the previous paragraph the actions we take have far- reaching consequences and a collective impact, and thus my perception of what design is and the scale that I have been working in has changed leading me into a space of broad and interdisciplinary questions of the world we are living in and what world we want to live in. It is an uncomfortable situation of being in an unknown space, feeling lost in where I want to go and where I could be useful. A feeling that origins from constant questioning of oneself and the world around us. A space that I can literally say that I am constantly searching and moving towards as I also deep down believe that when in unease and completely out of the comfort zone we have a greater ability to make changes. At the moment I am studying the second term of MDEF and I have during these two terms tried to work hard on accepting and embracing this feeling of lostness instead of trying to dismiss, analyse or \u2018solve\u2019 it. According to Dr. Akomolafe the first step toward emancipatory wholeness is finding comfort in the unknowable, and embracing bewilderment and wonder (Atmos, 2023). I would say that it is easier said than done, we are still living in a world where we are constantly met with pressures to achieve more, act faster and be better, so how is that done when you have a feeling that you don\u2019t know what you are doing? How do you learn and lead in times of disruption when you cannot rely on the experiences of the past? A question posed by Otto Scharmer about 20 years ago and resulted in the method and framework for the U Theory. It is an awareness-based method for changing systems blending systems thinking, innovation, and leading change from the viewpoint of an evolving human consciousness. It draws attention to the invisible source dimension of the social field, to the quality of relationships that we have to each other, to the system, and to ourselves. The theory is visualised as a U where we start at the top of the U and as we move down one side of the U we allow ourselves to connect to the world that is outside of our institutional bubble. When at the bottom of the U, we can connect to the world that emerges from within. This space requires us to drop everything that isn\u2019t essential where the process of letting-go of our selves as we have been and are establishes a subtle connection to a deeper source of knowing before moving up the other side of the U as a better future self. The essence of presencing is that these two selves\u2014our current self and our best future Self\u2014meet at the bottom of the U and begin to listen and resonate with each other. When this subtle threshold is crossed, nothing remains the same and you begin to operate with a heightened level of energy and sense of future possibilities that could begin to function as an intentional vehicle for an emerging future (Sharmer, 2022). The past year leading up to joining the Master in Design for Emergent Futures has been a path leading to the bottom of the U and I can feel how my two selves are connecting, creating this feeling of lostness when my outer and inner self are debating. This does although mean that I am moving forward and it helped me to understand what Dr. Akomolafe means with finding comfort in the unknown and embracing it. My journey will keep moving by doing and acting towards becoming a one with what I do and with who to move towards the other side of the U. In a time of environmental, social and personal uncertainty I will do this by slowing down, not in speed but in awareness or presence, to listen to my inner self that I can hear has something to say about my outyerself and what I am doing. \u2018To slow down is to hack the machine, like we\u2019re taking on other forms of body that allow us to penetrate into different kinds of realities\u2014other worlds\u2019 as Dr Akomolafe says (Atmos, 2023). We need to work together as one for regenerative design and futures. https://www.innerdevelopmentgoals.org/framework The Inner Development Goals (IDGs) is a not for profit and open source initiative.

What is data and what is information? What is the difference? Data is defined as individual facts in raw form. It can come in the form of for example text, observations, figures, images, numbers, graphs, or symbols. There are two main types of data - Quantitative data which is provided in numerical form, like the weight, volume, or cost of an item, and Qualitative data which is descriptive, but non-numerical, like the name, sex, or eye color of a person. On its own data can be useless or without significance, until it is analyzed, organized, and interpreted. Information is defined as knowledge gained through study, communication, research, or instruction and is the result of organising, analysing and interpretating pieces of data. Information maps out data to provide a big-picture view of how it all fits together. When the data is organized and compiled in a useful way can it provide information that is beneficial to others and when combining these components together it can help identify and solve problems.

We all understand things differently and will therefor also present information differently. The importance of access to be able to interpret the facts becomes of importance for all people to have access to information. There are different types of access - Open (wikipedia, anyone can access) vs Shared (limited sharing ex instagram if not logged in can\u2019t access etc) vs Closed data (only small restricted access, ex bank account).

How you present data can create different narratives depending on who does it, the access to raw data gives the possibility to understand the source and create other narratives for more people to understand.

We could do this through understanding overall how the built environment affects us, through air quality, lighting, colors, furniture and overall interior. We were introduced to a couple different tools that could be used within the groups to measure different qualities. Our group used the Smart Citizen Kit to be able to measure air quality, CO2, light, particles and noise.

C O N C E P T For the past months we have been volunteering with the organisation Clean Beach Intiative. They organise weekly beach cleaning sessions every Staurday at Barceloneta. Through this experience we realised the amount of micro plastics, and the difficulty to collect them with the tools provided. We have therfor been experimenting and testing different nets and tools to collect these small pieces more efficiently. Everything that is collected during the session is later sorted and weighed to be recycled. All the very small pieces take too long to sort from all the bags and are therefor thrown in the normal trash. We want to create tools to collect and sort these smaller pieces.

As we have been volunteering and working together for a while, we had already tested some tools and had a clearer idea of how to structure the Micro Challenge. We brought the tools we created to the organised Beach Clean and let the volunteers test them and use them. We received valuable feedback on form and use, where we will be changing the form of the hand sieve to make it easier to dig through the sand. Overall the tools were helpful and can be further developed. This Micro Challenge was for me a better way of using my skills of production and actually using the machines. I do think that even though we had a clearer vision of what we wanted to create and use the challenge for, that the whole thing is very rushed and it becomes a lot of creating things for the sake of creating just because we have to use the specific machines we have learned about the weeks before. It came to our knowledge that we can use the weekly assignments to create things for the Micro Challenge which I\u2019ll be doing for the third and last one, and using that time to be useful for our project instead.","title":"Micro Challenge II"},{"location":"term2/10-Future%20Talks/","text":"F U T U R E T A L K S \u00b6 This term has been very intense with many scheduled lectures and group meetings, where I started to lose motivation and inspiration along the way.

They are produced in huge factories out of materials that also travel long distances before reaching the factory for mass production of standardised products that leave no room for individualisation, repair or knowledge about the origins or process. Distributed Design is a novel approach to design which utilises global connectivity to move data, instead of product. The approach rethinks how goods are produced and from what materials whilst aiming to enhance the customer\u2019s relationship with their products - Distributed Design Market Platform (Distributed Design Market Platform, 2018) Distributed Design has its origins in maker culture and celebrates tinkering, hacking and serious play but it also has the potential to reduce the environmental and social impact of manufacturing and engage consumers to become active citizens through making. The central question is not only how objects and data themselves can be distributed, but also value and power. The contemporary distributed designer needs to be able to embody multiple perspectives but instead of the nodes being those of customers and clients they must also include communities, objects, rivers, companies, and all living beings. Designing this way is an opportunity to experience and become aware of the complex systems behind things, which in turn can change your mindset. - Driven by Distributed Design: Nat Hunter and Gareth Owen Lloyd from Other Today ( www.youtube.com , n.d.) More than 70 percent of a product\u2019s environmental impact is decided in the design phase.* This makes design and designers a key factor in the circular transition. Distributed design can help fuel that transition - DDC \u2013 Danish Design Center (DDC \u2013 Danish Design Center, 2021) Distributed design is a design approach that involves decentralizing the design process by dividing labor and sharing information digitally. Instead of shipping materials and products around the world, data is shared to enable local production using locally sourced and sustainable materials. In distributed design, users are empowered to take ownership of their products on a whole new level, and the relationship between designer and user is transformed. Users can impact the design by sharing feedback, ideas, and suggestions, which allows for a closer collaboration between designer and user. This design approach can result in products that are more sustainable, durable, and in tune with the needs of the consumer. Distributed design offers designers the opportunity to rethink how they design, produce and consume products, and to take responsibility for designing products that are durable, repairable, and reusable. By designing and producing products locally, using locally sourced and sustainable materials, designers can significantly reduce the ecological footprint of their products. The relationship between designer and user is also transformed in distributed design, with users empowered to take ownership of their products and impact the design. By sharing information and opening up the design process, designers can establish closer collaborations with users, which can lead to the creation of products that are more in tune with consumer needs. The challenge for designers is to be willing to open up their design process and truly listen to their users in order to create products with a positive social and environmental impact. Dialogue as a design tool \u201cIt is no longer an authoritarian relationship. I\u2019m no longer selling you a chair that you can\u2019t change. I\u2019m making the chair open source, and we can have a dialogue about how that chair should be made for you,\u201d says product designer Alex Kimber. (DDC \u2013 Danish Design Center, 2020) It was really great to have a course in Distributed Design with Sally and Olga. It was when I found the Distributed Design Platform and started learning more about this that I actually found the Master in Design for Emergent Futures. Coming from a background in furniture and product design where I was questioning the practice with how things are made, where and why that Distributed Design caught my attention of looking at other ways to produce things locally and minimizing the impact of materials, production and transportation. R E F L E C T I O N T R E E The goal of the Reflection tree is to help you to evaluate a selected project so you can understand your project\u2019s impact in relation to the Distributed Design Platform values. By reflecting on the values, you can identify your project\u2019s alignment with Distributed Design; the impact you\u2019re already creating in your project; and begin to identify what you might like to improve on in the short, mid- and longterm. Responses to the Reflection Tree will also help us as a platform provide better resources to support you on your journey to creating a project that is open, collaborative, regenerative, and ecosystemic. It has three main features: the Distributed Design Platform values; a space for resources and reflections; and a summary evaluation space. The values move from basic to more complex approaches. Meanwhile, the intervention stages are divided into the design phase, production phase, lifecycle and end of life phase and, lastly, wider or spill over effects. Also, the last phase relates to your intervention\u2019s overall impact and your capacity to apply systemic design. In practice, we know that you likely will never move through these stages in a unilateral direction, but will go back and forth between them, i.e. between the design and production phase while you test your prototype. Using the reflection tree on the project Future Cravings that is a dinner experience where the tableware and food courses are made of the same ingredients with a special focus on waste and regenerative resources. The dinner includes a performative aspect as a playful prompt to ink the experience in memory and as a springboard for critical conversation. The first event focused on the subject of plastic waste in the sea, and we invited organisations and individuals with a background in this subject to attend. Our hope is that through this dinner, we can have a conversation that allows us all to ideate differently around this subject and perhaps find clues / solutions that we might not have otherwise. In a way this is us trying out a new methodology for climate action, based on the original problem solving forum: the dinner table (or the fire pit depending on how far back you go). For me this exercise was a really good way to reflect on a project, looking at what we think are important values to work from and questioning how intact they are within the project. It is always difficult to rate yourself or projects you are working on objectively, although this became secondary for me when doing this exercise, as it instead became good questions to ask along the way to understand what else can be done to make the project better and move in the desired direction to benefit as many as possible. We also did an exercise where we shared our values within the class, something I can find difficult to pinpoint concretely sometimes as there are many that are important to me, but it was a good exercise to find words that communicate them. We then in groups had a chosen value that we were to analyse and reflect on where I together with four others worked with Curiosity and inclusivity. We had a long dialogue about why curiosity is an important value and how it could lead to inclusivity. Curiosity has existential cores of beings and other living things to survive, without it we wouldnt have a reason to live and evolve I think. It is also an important contribitor to collaboration, to be curious of other people, things and perspectives with an empathy for other ways and thoughts from those we have ourselves. Curiosity is therfor also a channel to inclusivity. For us to be curiosu and inclusive it is though important to have time and mental space to be able to be curious. If in a space where you only have time and space to survive the day, if from stress, mental health or economic situations curiosity has less space. We also agreed to some extent that inclusivity is a consious act that needs to be practiced. We spoke about many more things and this assignment was a very good way to dig deep into a word that we call value and think are important, and many times use without really reflecting on what we mean by it and what impcat it can have, both positive and negative. L E A R N I N G S K I L L S When doing the Reflection Tree and Value assignment it helped to be able to look at yourself, projects and values with an analytical and critical mind. It gives different perspectives and looks at both positive and negative impacts. D Y N A M I C S Within our group we had different ways of understanding and tackling things this created impactful and interesting discussions that helped us look at things from many different perspectives and get a broader understanding. I very much appreciate the differences within the group and how we had meaningful discussions due to these differences. I N T E R A C T I O N S When working with the value assignment I took on the roll to start writing down & illustrating what we were talking about. It is a roll I agree with as I communicate strongly visually, it didn\u2019t influence my opinion per say about the topic, more inspired me more. R E F E R E N C E S DDC \u2013 Danish Design Center.
