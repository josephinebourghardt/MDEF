# **STUDIO II**

The first term involved a lot of feelings of being lost, trying to understand what subjects interest me, letting go of control and learning and moving forward by doing. The term was compact with different courses that helped explore subjects from different perspectives. During the term I have personally worked on understanding my passions, communicating what I am good at within a group and practicing to communicate projects and thoughts verbally with contacts to find opportunities of intervention. 

During the second term I want to keep volunteering and working with Food not Bombs and Esperanca. There are connections between these organisations that can be interesting to keep working together on. I personally want to keep working with Bio Materials and waste as a hands on part of projects, as well as explore more with AI. 

Alongside the extended work with waste and the channel food waste, I want to work with the subject of water. I started to understand during the first term that the subjects of food, water and energy are core subjects of interest. I am at the moment exploring different ways to approach this broad subject, but seek to again be open minded about areas of intervention where a fluid process can lead to unexpected opportunities. 

Starting the term I am exploring different perspectives and systems of water. The 24th of January I will together with some others interested in water, be going to the Waste Water Management in Barcelona to visit the centre and see how the city works with this. In December I visited a wastewater management outside of Gothenburg Sweden. This can be a great opportunity to look at similarities and differences between countries that have opposite relationships to water, where Gothenburg aims to become the best rain city and Spain and Barcelona are in long periods of drought. 

I’ll also be investigating how others works with water, where I have contacts working within The Ocean Race, where I’ll be visiting the event to speak with departments working with sustainability and water, as well as how the municipality of Alicante works with the subject during the event.
