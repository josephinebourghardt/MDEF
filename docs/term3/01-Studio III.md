29.04.23 · Micro Plastic Workshop

This opportunity arose from the evolved collaboration and dialogues we have had with Clean Beach Initiative while participating in the beach cleanups they arrange on Saturdays. They have had contact with Centro de la Playa in the past but without continuation. To introduce the tools we have been working on to collect microplastics during the cleanup and to reconnect with Centro de la Playa we togehter organised a workshop where they will speak about how they work with the topic, we will show the tools and learnings we’ve had during the cleanups, therafter together use the tools while cleaning the beach and at the end have a dialogue about the outcomes and a brainstorming session to unlock topics and ideas that could contribute to cleaner beaches. 

This session will hopefully introduce our individual work and let us find possible collaborations within our mutual goals. 

Through the brainstorming session we are looking to ask how we can involve people on the beach to be more aware and active about keeping the beach clean, If there are possibilities for something permanent on the beach that could be used by organizations or general public? We will prepare the workshop with photos of other interventions around the world, as well as some topics in different scales to start conversations and the imagination.
