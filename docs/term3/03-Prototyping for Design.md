Through advancements in technology the use of robots is becoming cheaper and cheaper. A robotic arm can be used for measuring, 3D scanning, cutting, milling, drawing, spaying, 3D printing, assembling as some examples. 

Robotic arms are machines that are programmed to execute a specific task or job quickly, efficiently, and extremely accurately. Generally motor-driven, they’re most often used for the rapid, consistent performance of heavy and/or highly repetitive procedures over extended periods of time, and are especially valued in the industrial production, manufacturing, machining and assembly sectors.

A typical industrial robot arm includes a series of joints, articulations and manipulators that work together to closely resemble the motion and functionality of a human arm (at least from a purely mechanical perspective). A programmable robotic arm can be a complete machine in and of itself, or it can function as an individual robot part of a larger and more complex piece of equipment.(https://ie.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=ideas-and-advice/robotic-arms-guide)

The end effector
An end effector is a device located at the end of a robotic arm. It is designed to interact with the environment in which the robotic arm is to be used. You can think of the end effector as the app which makes the robotic arm perform a variety of functions. The job of the robotic arm is to move the end effector from one location to the other based on the commands that the user sends via a control computer.
The design of the end effector will depend on the applications for which the robotic arm is intended to be used. The end effector is also known as a robotic hand. It can be designed to perform spinning, gripping, welding, and assembly operations.
A robotic arm can be fitted with a variety of end effectors. One of the most commonly fitted end effectors is the one which resembles the human hand. It is used extensively for picking, gripping, and carrying different types of objects. (https://3dinsider.com/what-are-robotic-arms/)

During this class we were introduced to robots, how they work, what they can do and how to use them. We got a small introduction to the robot that are at IAAC, how to calibrate it and some people in class got to play with the controls. As an assignment we were to install the Robot Library in Grasshopper and play around with it and then simulate the movement.

There is always a lot of discussion on wich 3d modeling tool is the best to learn and use, most of the time it comes down to personal preference and becomes an almost religious fight.
In my opinion we should talk and think about some other aspects on why we choose one tool or the other, here are some thoughs:
The tools that we use, shape ourselves and the things we do.
The design of the tool, limits our capacity to create solutions, and influences how we face problems.
Our creative freedom has to struggle against the rules imposed by the tool itself.
The reasons that motivate tool designer decisions are not always aligned with our objectives.
In commercial tools, profit is prioritized in design decisions.
A tool that is created by a comunity has more potential to be diverse in the paradigms it imposes.
Modifying the tool itself should be a normal part of the creative process to allow a wider range of outputs.
An open source tool by definition allows (and even promotes) us to change it to fit our needs.

Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these are included in Blender’s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process. Examples from many Blender-based projects are available in the showcase.
Blender is cross-platform and runs equally well on Linux, Windows, and Macintosh computers. Its interface uses OpenGL to provide a consistent experience. To confirm specific compatibility, the list of supported platforms indicates those regularly tested by the development team.
As a community-driven project under the GNU General Public License (GPL), the public is empowered to make small and large changes to the code base, which leads to new features, responsive bug fixes, and better usability. Blender has no price tag, but you can invest, participate, and help to advance a powerful collaborative tool: Blender is your own 3D software.

*Interface (Computing): a device or program enabling a user to communicate with a computer. "a graphical user interface”*

During this class we were introduced to interfaces and how ... works with them. She works with 'Interaction, Electronics and Embodiment', asking the questions *How can I use my body, movement, senses and electronics and sensors? What is the body? How can I use this question as a concept or idea?* Working from a 1st person perspective using sensors, audio and video on her own body to understand the feelings about using them, understanding them and then sharing this info through electronic arts and digital arts. She has been working with electronics in different ways collaborating with the body and movement, with robots, lights and media. Her work is a dialogue between the question, digital media, visuals and electronics. 


She wanted to understand the way we construct our identity with the environments around us, through relationships with people and things, and how do we build our bodies and identities when were so connected to technology and digital where the internet is always with us. We were then introduced to her work with Live-streaming and how others work with it. (cuerpo transceptor)

Live Coding - The practice of using code as a tool for music and visuals with the intention to always share the code openly.


TOPLAP Barcelona is a collective that practices and promotes live coding as a sound and visual creation technique, generating a technological appropriation through the use and development of free and open software focused on generating its own relationships and discourses. https://toplapbarcelona.hangar.org

Allows to improvise, shows the screens and shows how people are working with the side.

Hydra : Language by Olivia Jack

Inspired by modular synthesisers making it for image
We were introduced to the tool Hydra https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_id=example_16 where we could play live with code to generate visuals. We played around withe numbers and were shown how to start from the beginning with code to create new ones. We were shown how camera and audio could be used as parameters in the code as well using the computers camera and microphone. 

It was for me a very cool tool to play with code in a fun way for someone who is not directy interested in coding, but would like to learn a bit more. By changing code or changing parameters the visualisation changes also.

In class we were introduced to using Python interface as a way to access anything in Blender. Together with Victor we made shapes and commands with simple code. We then connected a phone as a sensor that streams directly to the code where we could move objects through moving the phone. 

*Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high-level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. Python scripts are a versatile way to extend Blender functionality. Most areas of Blender can be scripted, including animation, rendering, import and export, object creation and automating repetitive tasks.* (https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/scripting/introduction.html)


As a hands on assignment we also connected a LED to Arduino that was then connected to Blender, where the LED could be controlled directly from Blender. 


It was very useful to see the different possibilities of using Python in Blender, although at this point I am more interested in learning to use Blender for 3D modelling, animation and rendering where I for the moment am not in need of simplifying too many tasks or using add ons. But for the future when I am more skilled in the program and know what I want to use it for, this is valuable to know and I would like to learn the basics, but will most probably collaborate with people who enjoy coding more than I do.
