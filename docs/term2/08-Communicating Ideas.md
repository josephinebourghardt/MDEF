Humans construct worlds by attributing meaning to otherwise meaningless things
Communication forms the basis of this meaning making
Communication is the transfer of information, ideas, emotions, feelings between people
We use symbols, cultural codes, signs in verbal and non-verbal formats.

Emergent futures are, by description, new and therefore can be unknown 
Itâ€™s our responsibility to ensure our ideas are made accessible and understandable
In designing emergent futures, we are also responsible for designing the intangible meaning and communicative impact of the ideas we put into the world

-Kate Armstrong, presentation for MDEF

This course is to understand and reflect on what we are communicating and to who, where and how. 

It is important to understand what communication is - One cannot not communicate - an expression by the Austrian communication expert Paul Watzlawick that I think is really nice, because everything we do is communication, from language, to bodylanguage, clothes, expressions, posture to fonts, images, chosen projects. Everything we do is communication, either chosen or not. 

I have started to make a new website to try and illustrate who I am and the projects I have worked on in a way that reflects on my values and communication.

Who are we contacting? Engage with the right people, the clearer your target is, the easier it is to reach them and the more targeted your message, the better the potential outcome.

Work smarter, not harder. Focus on serving the people that give the best investment for you. What stakeholders and audiences are in your project?
