# **REMIXING MATERIALS**

18.01.23 - 20.01.23

Continuing into the second week of Term II we dove deeper into the principles of Bio Materials, with new techniques of creation, manipulation, understanding possibilities of use and communication strategies. With collected waste from around the city we prototyped with different recipes to understand qualities and properties of different techniques and combinations. During the first semester I, together with a group of four others, explored Bio Materials and waste, specifically food waste, which made this course an engaging continuation of the explorations we had started, specifically learning more about processes and methods that can be used when collecting, processing, manipulating and manufacturing. 

We were introduced to different methods of analysing and visualising use and life cycles and how and where we could project thoughts into our surroundings. We looked at lifecycles and processes of extraction & processing, manufacturing/crafting, (casting, molding, shaping, joining, surfacing, additive), manufacturing (printing, extruding), subtractive, manufacturing (milling, drilling), blowing, melting, pressing, cooking, cutting, drying, sculpting, carving, grinding, mixing, sanding, etc., consumption/use and end of the life and disposal.

During the first term we mostly explored different recipes and possibilities, where during this term and this course I want to evolve this work and explore the different manufacturing processes we’ve been introduced to such as 3D printing, moulding, casting and milling with Bio Materials. With the course I also want to explore and learn more about how to express different applications of materials, and how to create communicative and relatable narratives and mediums of expression.

GROWING MATERIALS with S Biótica

We visited S Biotic and their studio where we were introduced to their practice and how the use and learn from growing living materials. We spoke about how materials can be living and transforming as we do with their own communication and narratives, rhythms and cycles. We are living in a time where we as consumers are detached from the materials around us. How can taking a step back to reflect and analyse on how materials make you feel, think, connect and collaborate with non human life, organic and living materials create a regenerative connection to the world and our surroundings? 

An interesting topic is how we live in an ever changing world but still have the perception that the things that we make and the materials we produce need to hold for a very long time. What if we were to instead mimic the aspect of the living, using the life cycle in design processes and other directions and question what is it to be and think with care when designing with the living around us. Should materials and products really hold for hundreds of years, or could the lifespan of a material be only of what it is to be used for and later deteriorate and return to nature with the nutrients needed. 

It was also interesting to talk about how working with other living organisms is a collaboration between a designer and other living things. You can tell it what to do, but that doesn’t mean that it will do it. An aspect that can be hard to grasp within traditional design thinking where human needs are at the centre of solutions and humans have controlled the outcomes. Letting go of control as a designer and letting others be a part of deciding the process is what can lead to innovation solutions, as seen in many topics of collaborations between disciplines, so collaborating with other living organisms should be a natural part of this process as well. 

To understand this collaboration hands-on we worked with mycelium, learning about the specific properties, feeding, temperature and processes for it to grow in molds that we brought.
