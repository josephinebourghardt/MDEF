# D E S I G N  E T H I C S

During this class we were introduced to different ethics and filosofical theories as well as having discussions about what ethics in design actually is. A very interesting and important subject within design and something that very much reflects the master we are studying, therefor it felt very sad that we had this class so late on in the third term. It would be very helpful to start this class in the first terms, and preferably more classes as they reflect what we are doing in the master, but I think very much why we have chosen it, and explains this in useful words and thoughts. 

What is design? The answer to that question can very much vary depending on who you are asking. It can be the creation, plans or prototype of an artefact, but can also be seen as the configuration or reconfiguration of ways of living, as a strategic way. 

What is a designer? Everyone can be a designer, remodelling their homes, writing posts in the stairway for neighbours, building things etc, everything we have around us is design, problemsolving in different ways. But if the question relates to a profession, not everyone is a designer in practice, as an occupation or professional activity. Design as a profession can be harder to define as it isn't as clear as other professions, say for example a nurse or a doctor - their purpose as a profession is to keep people healthy.
