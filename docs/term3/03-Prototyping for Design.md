Through advancements in technology the use of robots is becoming cheaper and cheaper. A robotic arm can be used for measuring, 3D scanning, cutting, milling, drawing, spaying, 3D printing, assembling as some examples. 

Robotic arms are machines that are programmed to execute a specific task or job quickly, efficiently, and extremely accurately. Generally motor-driven, they’re most often used for the rapid, consistent performance of heavy and/or highly repetitive procedures over extended periods of time, and are especially valued in the industrial production, manufacturing, machining and assembly sectors.

A typical industrial robot arm includes a series of joints, articulations and manipulators that work together to closely resemble the motion and functionality of a human arm (at least from a purely mechanical perspective). A programmable robotic arm can be a complete machine in and of itself, or it can function as an individual robot part of a larger and more complex piece of equipment. (https://ie.rs-online.com/web/generalDisplay.html?id=ideas-and-advice/robotic-arms-guide)

The end effector
An end effector is a device located at the end of a robotic arm. It is designed to interact with the environment in which the robotic arm is to be used. You can think of the end effector as the app which makes the robotic arm perform a variety of functions. The job of the robotic arm is to move the end effector from one location to the other based on the commands that the user sends via a control computer.
The design of the end effector will depend on the applications for which the robotic arm is intended to be used. The end effector is also known as a robotic hand. It can be designed to perform spinning, gripping, welding, and assembly operations.
A robotic arm can be fitted with a variety of end effectors. One of the most commonly fitted end effectors is the one which resembles the human hand. It is used extensively for picking, gripping, and carrying different types of objects. (https://3dinsider.com/what-are-robotic-arms/)

During this class we were introduced to robots, how they work, what they can do and how to use them. We got a small introduction to the robot that are at IAAC, how to calibrate it and some people in class got to play with the controls. As an assignment we were to install the Robot Library in Grasshopper and play around with it and then simulate the movement.
