In the present most products we buy travel thousands of kilometres before they reach the consumer. They are produced in huge factories out of materials that also travel long distances before reaching the factory for mass production of standardised products that leave no room for individualisation, repair or knowledge about the origins or process. 

Distributed Design is a novel approach to design which utilises global connectivity to move data, instead of product. The approach rethinks how goods are produced and from what materials whilst aiming to enhance the customer’s relationship with their products - Distributed Design Market Platform (Distributed Design Market Platform, 2018)

More than 70 percent of a product’s environmental impact is decided in the design phase.* This makes design and designers a key factor in the circular transition. Distributed design can help fuel that transition - DDC – Danish Design Center (DDC – Danish Design Center, 2021)

Distributed design is a design approach that involves decentralizing the design process by dividing labor and sharing information digitally. Instead of shipping materials and products around the world, data is shared to enable local production using locally sourced and sustainable materials. In distributed design, users are empowered to take ownership of their products on a whole new level, and the relationship between designer and user is transformed. Users can impact the design by sharing feedback, ideas, and suggestions, which allows for a closer collaboration between designer and user. This design approach can result in products that are more sustainable, durable, and in tune with the needs of the consumer.

Distributed design offers designers the opportunity to rethink how they design, produce and consume products, and to take responsibility for designing products that are durable, repairable, and reusable. By designing and producing products locally, using locally sourced and sustainable materials, designers can significantly reduce the ecological footprint of their products. The relationship between designer and user is also transformed in distributed design, with users empowered to take ownership of their products and impact the design. By sharing information and opening up the design process, designers can establish closer collaborations with users, which can lead to the creation of products that are more in tune with consumer needs. The challenge for designers is to be willing to open up their design process and truly listen to their users in order to create products with a positive social and environmental impact.

Dialogue as a design tool “It is no longer an authoritarian relationship. I’m no longer selling you a chair that you can’t change. I’m making the chair open source, and we can have a dialogue about how that chair should be made for you,” says product designer Alex Kimber. (DDC – Danish Design Center, 2020)
