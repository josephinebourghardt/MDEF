I\u2019m Josephine. I have a background in Product/ Furniture design where my focus is working with social and environmental issues and how the things around us affect people, mental health and the environment. I am an analytical problem-solver with a desire to understand how things fit together in a greater context where finding patterns and connections in complex situations and systems become possibilities for reforming and improving. With interests in research, psychology, well-being and function I seek to localise the core and essence of a problem or situation, working with solutions where the sum of parts, materials, space, objects and people come together as a whole. My fight lies in creating a balance in the relationship between humans and nature and all that is in-between. Working with materials, production methods and communities to create regenerative environments. my website","title":"About"},{"location":"about/me/#about","text":"This is a space reflecting on pasts, the present and the future.

When starting The Master in Design for Emergent Futures we were asked to introduce ourselves and our \u2018Fight\u2019 or quest that drives us in a poster. The assignment was at this stage, for me, a difficult question to answer concretely as I have many fields of interest and that everything is connected.
