For this Micro Challenge we have been working with creating tools for part of a Beach Cleaning Kit.

C O N C E P T

For the past months we have been volunteering with the organisation Clean Beach Intiative. They organise weekly beach cleaning sessions every Staurday at Barceloneta. Through this experience we realised the amount of micro plastics, and the difficulty to collect them with the tools provided. We have therfor been experimenting and testing different nets and tools to collect these small pieces more efficiently.

Everything that is collected during the session is later sorted and weighed to be recycled. All the very small pieces take too long to sort from all the bags and are therefor thrown in the normal trash.

We want to create tools to collect and sort these smaller pieces. We would also like to be able to weigh them in the same way that the other waste is to communicate the amount of microplastics that are collected during this one hour session.

In the second Micro Challenge we had the goal of creating tools that we could use the following Staurday when volunteering with Clean Beach Initatives. As we have been volunteering and working together for a while, we had already tested some tools and had a clearer idea of how to structure the Micro Challenge. We brought the tools we created to the organised Beach Clean and let the volunteers test them and use them. We received valuable feedback on form and use, where we will be changing the form of the hand sieve to make it easier to dig through the sand. Overall the tools were helpful and can be further developed. This Micro Challenge was for me a better way of using my skills of production and actually using the machines. I do think that even though we had a clearer vision of what we wanted to create and use the challenge for, that the whole thing is very rushed and it becomes a lot of creating things for the sake of creating just because we have to use the specific machines we have learned about the weeks before. It came to our knowledge that we can use the weekly assignments to create things for the Micro Challenge which I'll be doing for the third and last one, and using that time to be useful for our project instead.
