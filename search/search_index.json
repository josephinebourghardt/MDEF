Weak signals can be defined as the first indicator of a change or an emerging issue in the present that may become significant in the future. Investigating and discovering weak signals has been used in business settings to spot upcoming trends for investment. The Atlas of Weak Signals is a toolkit consisting of cards that recognise weak signals, random triggers and areas of opportunity into a practical space to navigate and understand possible emerging scenarios based on underlying trends in our current world. It facilitates seeking opportunities, threats, challenges and shared visions for innovation, policymaking, intervention, research and business opportunities in the future. The first exercise when using the AoWS toolkit was to randomly choose two weak signals, three random triggers and one area of opportunity and analyse what these mean, how they can be connected and what possible interventions could be. This what a great exercise to start understanding the methodology of how they can be used without directly choosing own areas of interest. Afterwards we looked through all the cards and chose one that was associated with our \u2018fight\u2019 posters and vision. Thereafter we walked around the city to take photos of interventions regarding the card we chose. I chose the card Regenerative Design as it is an overall concept of my vision and Fight poster. While walking around the city I passed through the SuperBlocks in Sant Antoni, one of the projects opening up spaces in the city where cars have been dominant. The projects Super Blocks address challenges such as mobility, public space, bio diversity and social cohesion, involving the participation of local residents and organisations. It is a low cost, small scale intervention that adds spaces of greenery for both humans and animals to coexist in urban environments. While continuing the journey through the city I walked passed a wall of graffiti paintings, where one of the art pieces cited \u2018Lo que era antes\u2019 - what has been - with a painting of a flower growing out of a tin can. What if what we produced could actually provide nurture to this flower growing, instead of overusing this flowers natural resources and spreading material that it can\u2019t use\u2026 PERSONAL DESIGN SPACE This toolkit is part of a method to help us communicate thoughts and concepts while supporting to detect a direction of our vision and areas of interest. When starting on my personal design space showing areas of interest and direction narrowing down the selection of cards to just a few was a challenge. I realised I have many interests, although when connecting them there is an overall theme. The Weak Signals chosen were Climate Conscience, Fight Anthropocene Conflicts, Inter-Species Collaboration and Human-Machine Creative Collaborations , where Regenerative Design was placed in the middle as a random trigger and binding theme. The random triggers around these Weak Signals can be divided into different sub categories. One evolves around working with material resources and production locally and reusability to design within planetary boundaries. This is prolonged into the area of collaborating with machines, questioning supply chains where open source innovation, personal fabrication and local production such as neighbourhood FabLabs could take part in the challenges of the first area. To extend these areas into practice the area of communicating and educating residents and users becomes one of the seeds and necessities for interventions in the other areas to start. How can we design within planetary boundaries on a local level? How can we create awareness and understanding of what citizens can do with the resources that are around them? I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks where we will be introduced to many different topics, as well as reflecting and engaging with topics in my neighbourhood and home that can be opportunities of interest. Some areas of interest that have arised while producing this Design Space are learning more about bio materials and synthetic biology, how it can be produced, used and reused. Using what already exists in nature to decrease waste and regenerate fuel for existing ecosystems. Other topics are about recycling waste and the recycling systems that exist in the area that I live, which I feel to be hard to understand and use. Many people I have spoken to in the neighbourhood are also unsure of the procedures and how it works. Can these be improved and communicated more clearly to decrease waste in the area? Another area of interest was sparked when taking photos of the Superblocks for this weeks assignment. The area in Sant Antoni where this block is, has created a space for people and other living things to co-exist with less cars, more plants and space. It is great for biodiversity to create these spaces, yet every night it is completely lit up by the street lights contributing to light pollution in urban environments. This disrupts ecosystems posing threat in particular to nocturnal wildlife, having negative impacts on plant and animal physiology. It can confuse the migratory patterns of animals, alter competitive interactions of animals and cause physiological harm. The rhythm of life is orchestrated by the natural diurnal patterns of light and dark; so disruption to these patterns impacts the ecological dynamics with just as big effect on humans, who are dependent on natural body cycles and the production of melatonin, which are regulated by light and dark. If humans are exposed to light while sleeping, melatonin production can be suppressed, which can lead to sleep disorders and other health problems such as fatigue, stress and increased anxiety among other things. This topic comes from a direct effect of my own sleep being disrupted from the overflow of artificial light. The subjects and signals in my Design Space are areas I want to learn more about. I am at the moment looking at these areas from a bigger perspective, being open to opportunities that are arising around me that can lead to an understanding of what areas to more specifically focus on.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"Josephine Bourghardt 16.10.22 During the second week of MDEF we were introduced to the Atlas of Weak Signals.

The prototype as an experimental component where prototyping tests a hypothesis. Through statistical analysis the prototypes test attributes such as: usability tests of the prototypes, experiential trials to assess the design attributes such as aesthetics, color, texture details, material properties or cases where the prototype is treated as a physical hypothesis. In product and furniture design rapid prototyping is a substantial part of the design process to test and understand form aesthetically and functionally, scale, construction and usability. Usually starting in a scale of 1:5 to quickly create and assess alternations in form and structure. Thereafter moving on to a rapid prototype in the scale of 1:1 to assess proportions aesthetically to the human body and space. It is a quick way to assess and test alternations that are thereafter tested in a functional 1:1 scale prototype testing ergonomics, usability and interaction, details and materials. The prototype as a means of inquiry where prototypes are developed and deployed as instruments of inquiry to collect, record and measure phenomena. Prototypes are in this case used as an open-ended exploration to find information where there is no hypothesis. It can be a qualitative and /or quantitive study that can be combined with other methods of finding information such as interviews. During projects this way of using prototypes can be a great way of understanding material properties by experimenting structural attributes, reformation and qualities. It is also a great way to understand how people behave or understand situations to learn new perspectives and understandings of a situation by using cultural or digital probes. The prototype as a research archetype as embodiments of concepts, understandings or design spaces that can be argued to constitute contributions to the discipline. The role the prototype plays in this contribution is usually exemplary and used to show different possibilities of how things could be. It illustrates or demonstrates possibilities as a physical embodiment of research concept,\u2019understanding or design research space. It is conceptual and methodological, where the result doesn\u2019t have to be a physical product, but can be a render, sketch or visualisation. The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry where the process of making an artefact becomes a qualitative instrumental tool in design research. The process is documented, analysed, critically assessed and written up, and the research contribution is tied not to the artefact itself but the process of prototyping and how it generates knowledge. It becomes a driver for the direction of research and can be seen in Co-Design and Participatory Design as well as Digital and Cultural Probes where people are brought into the design process. With this method of prototyping many different perspectives and understandings are brought into the process and become direction in where the project could be moving towards. The process becomes the important direction and by documenting and assessing the information that becomes visible along the way is can give more knowledge and insight than the actual result, if there is one. Throughout projects the different roles of prototyping provide information to help understand the situation and assess if it\u2019s moving in the right direction and solving the right problem. In many projects they intertwine and are used within different phases of the process to collect and assess information and I use most of them in most projects to find inspiration, understand context and users, as a means of experimenting and testing hypothesis. During this year I\u2019m looking to work more with prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry, to work participatory with communities and other fields of expertise.

DESIGN SPACE","title":"DESIGN STUDIO"},{"location":"term1/04-BioAgriZero/","text":"BIO AGRI ZERO \u00b6 This week we were introduced to the basics of biology, synthetic biology and bio materials. Biology can be seen as the study of life and can be studied very broadly focusing on the whole planet or in very specific studies of for example microscopic structures like bacteria or DNA. We got an introduction to microbiology, the study of microorganisms, a diverse group of generally minute simple life-forms that include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. The field is concerned with the structure, function, and classification of such organisms and with ways of both exploiting and controlling their activities. Thereafter we made our own DIY laboratory and created an All Purpose Medium with simple ingredients that can be found in the local supermarket to grow and analyse living matter. We went hunting for bacteria and chose to take samples from the bathroom door handle and different fingerprints. This was placed in the incubator to later observe and analyse if or what kind of bacteria grows. We learned the importance of labelling and sorting samples to know what is what and how it has been handled, taking notes on recipes, procedures, changes and time slots. We learned the procedure of using scientific methods to experiment to be able to communicate and analyse outcomes. We looked at different tissue and organs through microscopes to understand how different microscopes work. Learning about the possibilities of making your own DIY microscope. With other recipes in the DIY Lab we made different Bio Materials, again with simple ingredients that can be found in supermarkets. Our group worked with Glycerine, Maizena and Vinegar, resulting in a Bio \u2018Plastic\u2019 with slightly transparent property depending on the thickness chosen. With flexible characteristics the thinnest sample seems to suit this recipe the best. Thereafter we learned how to grow Combucha and Spirulina. In the Agri part we learned about bees and beekeeping and farm projects with the use of technology. Throughout the course we have been working with theory alongside practical work. Learning how to work with DIY Bioplastics, as well as growing Spirulina, was very inspiring and something I\u2019ll be working with more at home to investigate recipes and textures. I\u2019m also interested to learn more about the opensource beehives and how to communicate these projects. Analysis - Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops Published 29 September 2021 By Pallab Ghosh In the BBC article \u2018Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops you can read about how the UK discusses allowing gene edited fruits and vegetables to be commercially grown and available. Due to Brexit, the UK is no longer a part of the European Union and therefor neither the restrictions they have regarding gene modified or edited farming and produce. Many scientists believe that they can use gene editing to develop fruit, vegetables and cereals that are more nutritious and productive, as well as hardier varieties that can withstand the extremes of weather brought about by climate change, but this is restricted in many countries (Ghosh, 2021). As populations keep growing it is expected that food production will have to double in the next 50 years. Unintentional environmental factors effect crops where an average of 33% of all fruit and vegetables are wasted or lost to causes such as disease, drought, extremes of temperature, and other environmental stresses. Plant gene editing has a profound potential to create new crops with desirable characteristics that could improve agricultural production. Manipulation of plant genomes has been achieved with the gene-editing tool CRISPR\u2013Cas9. Mutations in the genomes can apply and activate valuable traits in many crop species, such as lifecycles, additional nutrition and growth. This may improve the overall efficiency of fruit and vegetable production so that costs may be lowered, thereby bringing fresh produce within the means of more populations and strengthening the industry as well as worldwide health (Shipman, et al, 2021) These possibilities of changing the traits of produce to increase nutrition and production can definitely help solve some of the issues from growing populations and environmental impacts in the future, but at what cost? The article continues with discussing the UK governments future thoughts of also reviewing regulations of all genetically modified organisms which includes allowing commercial development and farming of gene-edited and genetically modified animals. This can make them more productive, resistant to some diseases and better withstand weather conditions. Many scientists and others within the field are welcoming these changes, while there are groups that are sceptical to the ethical impacts it can have on production methods and safety of animals and other living organisms. In another BBC article - \u2018Rules to create gene-edited farm animals must put welfare first - review\u2019 a report by the Nuffield Council for Bioethics warns that removing the current ban on the commercial development of gene-edited animals could increase livestock suffering. As farming is a business there can be different understandings and thoughts from breeders of farm animals where to tread a line between what they can get out of it and animal welfare. If gene edited animals could better tolerate poor conditions without any apparent health impacts it causes tension between the producer and animal welfare. In an experiment carried out during the 1980s a human gene was added into the DNA of pigs expecting them to grow faster and become leaner. The experiment succeeded where the pigs weight gain increased, together with feed efficiency, and carcass fat reduced. In a commercial and productive point of view this experiment was successful, but beyond these effects the pigs also suffered from several unanticipated serious health problems and suffering. \u201cThose involved in policing must look beyond solely questions of food safety and keep in mind an overall vision of a food and farming system that supports sustainable farming and improves standards of animal welfare (Ghosh, 2021). Reading these articles about subjects that could soon become reality pose the questions of who and what will be next? Human genome editing has the potential to advance our ability to treat and cure disease with benefits including faster and more accurate diagnosis, more targeted treatments and prevention of genetic disorders. Somatic gene therapies, which involve modifying a patient\u2019s DNA to treat or cure a disease, have been successfully used to address HIV, sickle-cell disease and transthyretin amyloidosis. The technique could also vastly improve treatment for a variety of cancers (World Health Organisation, 2021). It could also be used to trans-generationally \u2018correct\u2019 or avoid single-gene disorders entirely, but like in other fields of genetics and genomics, such as newborn screening, reproductive genetics or return of results, it is not possible to globally agree on what is right and wrong as this can be influenced by various factors, such as commercial pressure, a technological imperative, ideological or political views, or personal values. As well as associated values often differing between different groups, different cultures and countries. As with any new experimental therapeutic, the unknowns still outweigh what is known and issues of risk assessment and safety, risk/benefit calculation, patient monitoring, reimbursement, equity in access to new therapies and the potential for the unjustified draining of resources from more pressing therapies, particular protection for vulnerable populations, and informed consent remain important to study further (Howard, et al. 2018). We live in an era of rapidly evolving technologies, where we previously, not a very long time ago, had more time to assess and adjust or correct impacts. As the world around keeps evolving in an even quicker pace, how can we assess how it is impacting the environment, what this is doing to our habits, the cultural sense of who we are, and even more have time to adjust or correct instabilities before the future impacts become unrepairable? From gene editing fruits and vegetables, to animals and then curing diseases in humans, what would be the next step? Is this therapy or enhancement? To be able to enhance traits that can benefit humans and the environment are great, but to what extent? Who would have access to these enhancements? And who decides this? The ethical questions about new technologies and methods are of great importance to discuss before taking action just because the possibilities are there. To assess what the actual impacts could be from different perspectives and within different systems is a crucial part of the process, one that in many situations has to be re introduced. These questions should be just a as important within all fields, one of them being design. Discussing and reflecting on what we are doing, why we are doing it and how it will impact the environment and living things around us, now and in the future. Sources Ghosh, Pallab.

Biology can be seen as the study of life and can be studied very broadly focusing on the whole planet or in very specific studies of for example microscopic structures like bacteria or DNA. We got an introduction to microbiology, the study of microorganisms, a diverse group of generally minute simple life-forms that include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. The field is concerned with the structure, function, and classification of such organisms and with ways of both exploiting and controlling their activities. Thereafter we made our own DIY laboratory and created an All Purpose Medium with simple ingredients that can be found in the local supermarket to grow and analyse living matter. We went hunting for bacteria and chose to take samples from the bathroom door handle and different fingerprints. This was placed in the incubator to later observe and analyse if or what kind of bacteria grows. We learned the importance of labelling and sorting samples to know what is what and how it has been handled, taking notes on recipes, procedures, changes and time slots. We learned the procedure of using scientific methods to experiment to be able to communicate and analyse outcomes. We looked at different tissue and organs through microscopes to understand how different microscopes work. Learning about the possibilities of making your own DIY microscope. With other recipes in the DIY Lab we made different Bio Materials, again with simple ingredients that can be found in supermarkets. Our group worked with Glycerine, Maizena and Vinegar, resulting in a Bio \u2018Plastic\u2019 with slightly transparent property depending on the thickness chosen. With flexible characteristics the thinnest sample seems to suit this recipe the best. Thereafter we learned how to grow Combucha and Spirulina. In the Agri part we learned about bees and beekeeping and farm projects with the use of technology. Throughout the course we have been working with theory alongside practical work. Learning how to work with DIY Bioplastics, as well as growing Spirulina, was very inspiring and something I\u2019ll be working with more at home to investigate recipes and textures. I\u2019m also interested to learn more about the opensource beehives and how to communicate these projects. Analysis - Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops Published 29 September 2021 By Pallab Ghosh In the BBC article \u2018Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops you can read about how the UK discusses allowing gene edited fruits and vegetables to be commercially grown and available. Due to Brexit, the UK is no longer a part of the European Union and therefor neither the restrictions they have regarding gene modified or edited farming and produce. Many scientists believe that they can use gene editing to develop fruit, vegetables and cereals that are more nutritious and productive, as well as hardier varieties that can withstand the extremes of weather brought about by climate change, but this is restricted in many countries (Ghosh, 2021). As populations keep growing it is expected that food production will have to double in the next 50 years. Unintentional environmental factors effect crops where an average of 33% of all fruit and vegetables are wasted or lost to causes such as disease, drought, extremes of temperature, and other environmental stresses. Plant gene editing has a profound potential to create new crops with desirable characteristics that could improve agricultural production. Manipulation of plant genomes has been achieved with the gene-editing tool CRISPR\u2013Cas9. Mutations in the genomes can apply and activate valuable traits in many crop species, such as lifecycles, additional nutrition and growth. This may improve the overall efficiency of fruit and vegetable production so that costs may be lowered, thereby bringing fresh produce within the means of more populations and strengthening the industry as well as worldwide health (Shipman, et al, 2021) These possibilities of changing the traits of produce to increase nutrition and production can definitely help solve some of the issues from growing populations and environmental impacts in the future, but at what cost? The article continues with discussing the UK governments future thoughts of also reviewing regulations of all genetically modified organisms which includes allowing commercial development and farming of gene-edited and genetically modified animals. This can make them more productive, resistant to some diseases and better withstand weather conditions. Many scientists and others within the field are welcoming these changes, while there are groups that are sceptical to the ethical impacts it can have on production methods and safety of animals and other living organisms. In another BBC article - \u2018Rules to create gene-edited farm animals must put welfare first - review\u2019 a report by the Nuffield Council for Bioethics warns that removing the current ban on the commercial development of gene-edited animals could increase livestock suffering. As farming is a business there can be different understandings and thoughts from breeders of farm animals where to tread a line between what they can get out of it and animal welfare. If gene edited animals could better tolerate poor conditions without any apparent health impacts it causes tension between the producer and animal welfare. In an experiment carried out during the 1980s a human gene was added into the DNA of pigs expecting them to grow faster and become leaner. The experiment succeeded where the pigs weight gain increased, together with feed efficiency, and carcass fat reduced. In a commercial and productive point of view this experiment was successful, but beyond these effects the pigs also suffered from several unanticipated serious health problems and suffering. \u201cThose involved in policing must look beyond solely questions of food safety and keep in mind an overall vision of a food and farming system that supports sustainable farming and improves standards of animal welfare (Ghosh, 2021). Reading these articles about subjects that could soon become reality pose the questions of who and what will be next? Human genome editing has the potential to advance our ability to treat and cure disease with benefits including faster and more accurate diagnosis, more targeted treatments and prevention of genetic disorders. Somatic gene therapies, which involve modifying a patient\u2019s DNA to treat or cure a disease, have been successfully used to address HIV, sickle-cell disease and transthyretin amyloidosis. The technique could also vastly improve treatment for a variety of cancers (World Health Organisation, 2021). It could also be used to trans-generationally \u2018correct\u2019 or avoid single-gene disorders entirely, but like in other fields of genetics and genomics, such as newborn screening, reproductive genetics or return of results, it is not possible to globally agree on what is right and wrong as this can be influenced by various factors, such as commercial pressure, a technological imperative, ideological or political views, or personal values. As well as associated values often differing between different groups, different cultures and countries. As with any new experimental therapeutic, the unknowns still outweigh what is known and issues of risk assessment and safety, risk/benefit calculation, patient monitoring, reimbursement, equity in access to new therapies and the potential for the unjustified draining of resources from more pressing therapies, particular protection for vulnerable populations, and informed consent remain important to study further (Howard, et al. 2018). We live in an era of rapidly evolving technologies, where we previously, not a very long time ago, had more time to assess and adjust or correct impacts. As the world around keeps evolving in an even quicker pace, how can we assess how it is impacting the environment, what this is doing to our habits, the cultural sense of who we are, and even more have time to adjust or correct instabilities before the future impacts become unrepairable? From gene editing fruits and vegetables, to animals and then curing diseases in humans, what would be the next step? Is this therapy or enhancement? To be able to enhance traits that can benefit humans and the environment are great, but to what extent? Who would have access to these enhancements? And who decides this? The ethical questions about new technologies and methods are of great importance to discuss before taking action just because the possibilities are there. To assess what the actual impacts could be from different perspectives and within different systems is a crucial part of the process, one that in many situations has to be re introduced. These questions should be just a as important within all fields, one of them being design. Discussing and reflecting on what we are doing, why we are doing it and how it will impact the environment and living things around us, now and in the future. Sources Ghosh, Pallab.

Originally I thought I would want to save and store things in the companion that I find inspiring during the day, yet the opposite happened. I became very selective of what things I would consider carrying around because of the added weight it would include. It did however act as a great conversation starter of the impacts that our surroundings have on us, objects, spaces, media, mental health as some examples. The question of what is actually meaningful to the extent that you want to carry it with you, with the weight it brings. How do the surroundings and objects around us affect us and what weight do we carry with them? Do they weigh us down? How do thoughts and media affect us, when being connected to constant information flows, what follows us and do we actually choose to store this information or is it automatically stored? While reflecting on this, looking at this insect like object and imagining the body growing with things, you could visually see the legs becoming shorter and the body becoming heavier. Could this be a metaphor for the materialistic things we save and feel we need that the span and different directions we can reach with our \u2018legs\u2019 become shorter and we are weighed down by these things having a harder time to see things from other perspectives and move around in different spaces. The heavier you are the harder it can be to move and be flexible Could the legs actually be growing the more knowledge you get, meaning that you reach even more places, situations and knowledge? All of this without weighing down our bodies? What would happen if the companion did the opposite? What would I put inside that I don\u2019t want, and it would walk away with it? Although I usually work in this way, using myself as a tool, living with the ideas to test, this exercise was another level of doing this, as I was now also aware of doing it. It allows a place to start and then allows insights and other things to emerge along the way, giving deeper value to the insights or understanding that there are other subjects underlying what you thought you should work with. In a second intervention I wanted to investigate water and consumption. Fresh water as a resource can for many, including myself, be taken for granted as unlimited and a s easy as opening a faucet to access. When moving to Barcelona this was questioned with the simple situation of drinking water that\u2019s \u2018drinkable\u2019, but tasting very bad. Leading to the feeling of scarcity when water bottles are being emptied and the need to carry new ones up the stairs arise. Water is essential to all living things and access to fresh water should be a global right, yet in many parts of the world this is not the case where many people and living things are without access to freshwater. It made me wonder how much water I use daily and where this water comes from and how it\u2019s handled. During 24 hours I started to track and map the water that I used. It started at home, saving excess water in containers to understand how much water is wasted when washing hands, showering or washing dishes and other things. Very early on during the experiment I realised that I would be needing a lot of containers as they filled up extremely fast. When this water became visible I became very aware of the huge amounts of water I use, I also became very aware that this is the waste water that I can see. I began to investigate how much water that I can\u2019t see is used for the things that I don\u2019t associate with water, tracking water usage for food, clothes and objects. The insight of how much water is used during everyday life was intense, and when adding the water usage used for clothes, food, products etc I was shocked. I reflected on how I could use less water and realised that the amounts I could actually influence where low in everyday life. The realisation of the systems that were living in, where we have no idea how things are actually managed. To extend the intervention I want to use a predefined amount of water during a day, to investigate how I would distribute it and evaluate distribution. I want to understand the challenges and reflections it could entail. Would I be able to live this way? Would I choose to live this way, needing to evaluate many of the things I take for granted in everyday life, and choose which ones to do and whoch to not do anymore. Would other people do this?

How do we operate it and and how does it operate us? Do we have a critical relationship to the technology around us, do we know where and who it comes from and what information it collects and how this is used? The answer to most of these questions is - we don\u2019t know - until we start taking back control of the technology around us and take action to owning our own products. We need to understand what it is we are using, how it affects us and the processes and systems around it. Most products don\u2019t have the possibility for consumers to manipulate or repair software or hardware. They are often hard or impossible to disassemble without breaking parts. Companies behind these products and services have many excuses to keep control of the things that we think that we own. It can be security excuses - that our products become insecure if we start disassembling and handling them ourselves, and that the warranty expires if we do. Companies might have their own repair systems, giving them full control of the product from purchase to return. We are supposed to agree to software that cannot be changed, agreeing to use products exactly as a company has chosen, meaning that they have actually just lent us the product and we are not free to use it as we like. This gives us no freedom or possibility to repair or know if the parts are faulty or preprogrammed to stop working. If we don\u2019t ourselves understand how things work we have to trust the companies and systems around us, while they don\u2019t trust us, and if we don\u2019t have any knowledge about these products or systems we can\u2019t doubt or question this trust. As products have gotten more difficult to understand and repair, a growing right-to-repair movement has been pushing for legislation that requires access to make information and repair tools available to users. What impact does that have on society when things are hidden from us, who has the control when knowledge and information is hidden from us? During the first week of Tech Beyond the Myth we disassembled electronic products that no longer function to be able to understand the technology used and how things are built, as well as understand how they can be hacked and used in different ways. It is a way of understanding how we can take back control over the products around us. In a group of 5 we disassembled a Brother Inkjet Printer/ Scanner to understand the different parts and technologies it consists of. It is made up of two overall parts, one for scanning and one for printing. The top part consists of the image scan & fax scan and the bottom part consists of a printer and paper trays. The casing is made of different types of plastic, ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) which has mechanical properties such as impact resistance, toughness, and rigidity, PS-HI (Polysterine high Impact) a hard, solid plastic used frequently in products requiring certain rigidity, whilst offering elasticity and a good capacity for absorbing impact, POM (Polyoxymethylene) which is used for precision parts requiring high stiffness, low friction, and excellent dimensional stability and PPE-PS (Polyphenylene Ether + Polystyrene) which is a ductile material with excellent hydrolytic stability, flame resistance, and UV resistance. These properties make it ideal for applications in the process engineering, electrical, and medical industries. When looking at the inside of the case, it consists of several different mechanical and electronic parts with PC Boards, sensors and motors. The parts inside are made of different materials, there are parts in plastic, metal, rubber, wire and felt absorbers. Inkjet printers contain thousands of tiny holes that eject microscopic ink droplets onto the paper that passes through the printer. This process is performed at high speed with thousands of droplets ejected simultaneously resulting in the digital text or image transferred onto paper. MFC printers from Brother use a liquid ink produced either by a coloured dye or a liquid that contains solid pigments in suspension. Scanners work by shining light at a document. In simple terms, the reflected light is then directed onto photosensitive technology via mirrors and lenses, then converted into electronic data that is used to form a digital copy of the original. The printer could be turned on and power supply to the unit was stable, although we couldn\u2019t perform a \u2018print or scan test\u2019 to determine the actual issue. Upon lighting up, the screen displayed messages and the touchscreen could be interacted with, although showing an error message about connection to the server. When disassembling there were no faulty or broken parts so we reflected on possible theories for failure. One possiblity could be the maintenance unit, which cleans the printing carriage and makes adjustments for precise printing. Having a faulty maintenance unit could imply incorrect ink supply to the carriage, where it could be supplying more or less ink than needed or no ink at all. The maintenance unit could also be full, something that could easily be changed, if it wasn\u2019t that it is so well packed inside the printer that changing or cleaning it means taking apart the whole printer. This could be prepogrammed to sell more printers instead of maintaining the one you already have. Other possible malfunctions could be the sensors, mechanical parts or the electronics inside. Again these parts could be repaired or replaced if it was not for how the printer is constructed and put together, where replacing separate parts inside the printer require the whole thing being disassembled. Disassembling the printer tells us a lot about how it is built and how it works, but it also tells us a lot about what the company manufacturing it wants. When identifying the complex systems within the printer and how it\u2019s constructed, it\u2019s is interesting to understand how it can be so sold at such a low price? The ink cartridges all had chips, which could be used to communicate to the printer how much ink there is left for example, yet there was no sensor reading these chips. This could be to secure that customers only buy this specific ink for the printer to work. The biggest incomes for the company is usually the ink, so you could wonder if these chips are preprogrammed to be empty before they are to sell more ink for example? Can you hack these chips to use other types of ink? The exercise helped remove fear of the \u2018black box\u2019, and learn how different aspects of technology work. By reverse engineering the printer we understood the complexity of a device that executes such simple tasks. A printer has complex integrated systems, components and technology almost as robust as a computer. It was also surprising to see the amount of parts and components and the complexity of processes and systems involved in printing or scanning. What is an almost useless machine? What can we do with the parts from the disassembled printer? How can we hack everyday products to use them in different ways? How can tinkering be used in the process to learn and understand things? Forensics Report https://hackmd.io/@8sCwEDXZRLu279SP363xRQ/SkVrxUbHj By using different electronic parts from the printer, we started playing around with their use and function. The printer had two types of motors - Stepper motors and DC Motors, and several different types of sensors - Switch and Light sensors. The DC Motor was programmed with Arduino to have different speeds and change directions within different time slots. One of the DC motors we were using had a mechanical arm attached, when it started hitting the table while interacting with it we found the rhythm of the different sounds it could make exciting to investigate more. Through this different ideas of sound, light and behaviour emerged through the chaos/ process of playing. We started connecting other parts, making lights blink and switches connect humans with the machine. It became a rhythm machine, or a knocking machine, or just an almost useless machine. It can be a prank you place on someones door, that knocks aggressively until the door is opened, just to restart as it is closed again. Can that help people leave the house to go outside and enjoy nature, or is it a way to open doors and invite people to be more social, removing boundaries? Or can it be seen as all the information that is constantly being thrown at us through media, telling us what to do, who to be, how to be it, not stopping until we actively choose to remove ourselves from society? https://youtu.be/vhfmyTzN714 Can anything actually be useless or is there always a way to create value if we choose to? How can we use these electronics that were doomed useless and ready to be thrown away in other ways? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XLQnBHTC2d17FNC0QkpDw-hW02HmV_Sx/view?usp=sharing https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18by7NvocWw5UwcJ9cJGmSISv-FKvB2dR-m_RdzmnwxE/edit?usp=sharing","title":"Tech Beyond the Myth"},{"location":"term1/06-Tech%20Beyond%20the%20Myth/#tech-beyond-the-myth","text":"Everyday we interact with objects and interfaces that have technologies that we don\u2019t understand.

The casing is made of different types of plastic, ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) which has mechanical properties such as impact resistance, toughness, and rigidity, PS-HI (Polysterine high Impact) a hard, solid plastic used frequently in products requiring certain rigidity, whilst offering elasticity and a good capacity for absorbing impact, POM (Polyoxymethylene) which is used for precision parts requiring high stiffness, low friction, and excellent dimensional stability and PPE-PS (Polyphenylene Ether + Polystyrene) which is a ductile material with excellent hydrolytic stability, flame resistance, and UV resistance. These properties make it ideal for applications in the process engineering, electrical, and medical industries. When looking at the inside of the case, it consists of several different mechanical and electronic parts with PC Boards, sensors and motors. The parts inside are made of different materials, there are parts in plastic, metal, rubber, wire and felt absorbers. Inkjet printers contain thousands of tiny holes that eject microscopic ink droplets onto the paper that passes through the printer. This process is performed at high speed with thousands of droplets ejected simultaneously resulting in the digital text or image transferred onto paper. MFC printers from Brother use a liquid ink produced either by a coloured dye or a liquid that contains solid pigments in suspension. Scanners work by shining light at a document. In simple terms, the reflected light is then directed onto photosensitive technology via mirrors and lenses, then converted into electronic data that is used to form a digital copy of the original. The printer could be turned on and power supply to the unit was stable, although we couldn\u2019t perform a \u2018print or scan test\u2019 to determine the actual issue. Upon lighting up, the screen displayed messages and the touchscreen could be interacted with, although showing an error message about connection to the server. When disassembling there were no faulty or broken parts so we reflected on possible theories for failure. One possiblity could be the maintenance unit, which cleans the printing carriage and makes adjustments for precise printing. Having a faulty maintenance unit could imply incorrect ink supply to the carriage, where it could be supplying more or less ink than needed or no ink at all. The maintenance unit could also be full, something that could easily be changed, if it wasn\u2019t that it is so well packed inside the printer that changing or cleaning it means taking apart the whole printer. This could be prepogrammed to sell more printers instead of maintaining the one you already have. Other possible malfunctions could be the sensors, mechanical parts or the electronics inside. Again these parts could be repaired or replaced if it was not for how the printer is constructed and put together, where replacing separate parts inside the printer require the whole thing being disassembled. Disassembling the printer tells us a lot about how it is built and how it works, but it also tells us a lot about what the company manufacturing it wants. When identifying the complex systems within the printer and how it\u2019s constructed, it\u2019s is interesting to understand how it can be so sold at such a low price? The ink cartridges all had chips, which could be used to communicate to the printer how much ink there is left for example, yet there was no sensor reading these chips. This could be to secure that customers only buy this specific ink for the printer to work. The biggest incomes for the company is usually the ink, so you could wonder if these chips are preprogrammed to be empty before they are to sell more ink for example? Can you hack these chips to use other types of ink? The exercise helped remove fear of the \u2018black box\u2019, and learn how different aspects of technology work. By reverse engineering the printer we understood the complexity of a device that executes such simple tasks. A printer has complex integrated systems, components and technology almost as robust as a computer. It was also surprising to see the amount of parts and components and the complexity of processes and systems involved in printing or scanning. What is an almost useless machine? What can we do with the parts from the disassembled printer? How can we hack everyday products to use them in different ways? How can tinkering be used in the process to learn and understand things? Forensics Report https://hackmd.io/@8sCwEDXZRLu279SP363xRQ/SkVrxUbHj By using different electronic parts from the printer, we started playing around with their use and function. The printer had two types of motors - Stepper motors and DC Motors, and several different types of sensors - Switch and Light sensors. The DC Motor was programmed with Arduino to have different speeds and change directions within different time slots. One of the DC motors we were using had a mechanical arm attached, when it started hitting the table while interacting with it we found the rhythm of the different sounds it could make exciting to investigate more. Through this different ideas of sound, light and behaviour emerged through the chaos/ process of playing. We started connecting other parts, making lights blink and switches connect humans with the machine. It became a rhythm machine, or a knocking machine, or just an almost useless machine. It can be a prank you place on someones door, that knocks aggressively until the door is opened, just to restart as it is closed again. Can that help people leave the house to go outside and enjoy nature, or is it a way to open doors and invite people to be more social, removing boundaries? Or can it be seen as all the information that is constantly being thrown at us through media, telling us what to do, who to be, how to be it, not stopping until we actively choose to remove ourselves from society? https://youtu.be/vhfmyTzN714 Can anything actually be useless or is there always a way to create value if we choose to? How can we use these electronics that were doomed useless and ready to be thrown away in other ways? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XLQnBHTC2d17FNC0QkpDw-hW02HmV_Sx/view?usp=sharing https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18by7NvocWw5UwcJ9cJGmSISv-FKvB2dR-m_RdzmnwxE/edit?usp=sharing","title":"TECH BEYOND THE MYTH"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20Engagement/","text":"COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT \u00b6 During the past week we have been working with community engagement, understanding and learning about different tools to create local action-research projects with the goal of developing, testing, and implementing alternative and circular strategies towards a (more) locally productive and globally connected city. Those promoting participatory action-research believe that people have a universal right to participate in the production of knowledge which is a disciplined process of personal and social transformation. In this process, people rupture their existing attitudes of silence, accommodation and passivity, and gain confidence and abilities to alter unjust conditions and structures. Design is changing. For many years design has been associated with the practice of problem solving to change situations into preferred ones and to how things ought to be by using rational and analytic techniques. But who decides what ought to be and who\u2019s preferred situations are being realised? And what happens when a problem has innumerable causes, the issue\u2019s roots are complex and tangled, describing it is difficult and it changes with every attempt to address it and doesn\u2019t have a right answer? The concept of wicked problems was proposed by Rittel and Webber in response to the then dominant rational problem-solving methodology. These types of problems are not receptive to standard analytical problem solving techniques and may even worsen situations by generating undesirable consequences. To approach and address the issues of todays society there is a need of fundamental change at every level that require new approaches to problem solving. It calls for new ways of designing that are based upon a deep understanding of how to design for change and transition within complex systems. There needs to be an understanding of the interconnectedness of social, economic, political and natural systems to address problems at all levels of spatiotemporal scale in ways that improve quality of life. Transition Design advocates the reconception of entire lifestyles, with the aim of making them more place-based, convivial and participatory and harmonising them with the natural environment. It focuses on the need for \u2018cosmopolitan local- ism\u2019, a lifestyle that is place-based and regional, yet global in its awareness and exchange of information and technology and argues that design has a key role to play in these transitions. Transition designers view everyday life as a potentially powerful, transformative space to explore ways in which basic human needs are satisfied locally, within economies that exist to meet those needs. They draw on knowledge and wisdom from the past to conceive solutions in the present with future generations in mind. They study how large socio technical transitions have manifested throughout history and draw on the wisdom of pre-industrial indigenous societies who lived and designed sustainably in-place for generations (1). So how do we engage with the system and communities? To understand wicked problems and how to work with systems change we have worked with different tools like enabling actions to map actors and resources, analysing local contexts, identifying potential synergies and opportunities, and amplifying key benefits for local stakeholders. 'Stop being blinded by the illusion of control, systems can\u2019t be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned.. We can expect surprises, learn from them and even profit from them. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone. \u201cWe can\u2019t control systems or figure them out. But we can dance with them!' An important part of working within systems and communities is to understand how they work and the value that is already there and to do that you have to become part of and work within it. Communicate and experiment ideas, and keep learning through trial and error. Understand the behaviour in the community and pay attention to triggering events and outside influences that change or bring forward specific behaviours. Can these be changed from the outside? While looking at this its important to remember to zoom in and out of parts while still looking to maximise the system as a whole. The aim should be to enhance total systems properties, such as creativity, stability, diversity, resilience, and sustainability. *\u201cBefore you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves. If it\u2019s a piece of music or a whitewater rapid or a fluctuation in a commodity price, study its beat. If it\u2019s a social system, watch it work. Learn its history.\u201d* (2) TOOLS \u00b7 MAPPING Through mapping systems and systems within systems the aim was to understand how things affect each other and where in these systems to intervene. Working in a group interested in waste streams, at the moment specifically food waste, we started mapping the subject and the systems that exist around us. Looking at the challenges, what already exists and how it has been worked with locally and globally. Now we wanted to understand ways of working with food waste in the systems around us. TOOLS \u00b7 SENSEMAKING Cognitive Psychologists Robert R. Hoffman, Gary Klein, and Brian M. Moon define sensemaking as \u201ca motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places and events) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively\u201d (Klein, Moon, & Hoffman, 2006). A frame is an active perspective that both describes and perceptually changes a given situation We make sense of complicated ideas by doing them, rather than studying them abstractly. The process of sensemaking is a process of learning that relies on and is subjectively dependant on the entire summation of knowledge, emotions, and prior experiences in the learner. This builds heavily on John Dewey\u2019s view of experience as being fundamental for education, and implies that learning (and the process of solving complicated problems) must be an active process, and is always a subjective process. Reframing is the act of purposefully shifting the normative frame, often temporarily or in multiple directions at once, in order to see things from a new perspective. Designers may be able to manage multiple frames (commonly including \u201ctheir own\u201d, \u201cthe user\u2019s\u201c, and \u201cthe business\u2019s\u201c) and realize tradeoffs when various frames are given precedent (3). During this week we visited different creative communities to get an idea about how they work. We had seminars with Holon at Co\u00f2polis and learned ways of mapping communities and framing ideas and intervention points. We did a workshop in 4D mapping where the body is a means of framing a situation, where we worked with the subject of Higher Education. It was an interesting way to understand the complexity of systems and how we can understand them differently. We had already done an intervention within the group cooking with the food waste that we had saved during 3 days. It was an event that helped us understand the situation of individual food waste from a first person perspective and the possibilities that can be created with it. I learned a lot of ways to use all parts of vegetables and new recipes. To continue this intervention we have been looking for local creative communities within the area of Raval, a diverse and multicultural neighbourhood in Cuitat Vella, where some of us also live. A couple different opportunities arised with people in our surroundings that were also interested in the subject, including creating an art dinner with food waste, collecting food waste from a restaurant to experiment with biomaterials and the community garden Agora Juan Andres, where we will also be attending a community dinner that is arranged by the organisation Create Food not Bombs. During this community dinner we will be helping out during the event, but we also want to connect with the community and organisation and engage in possibilities of collaboration. We will also be observing and understanding the area and connections within it. *\u201dWe are all actors: being a citizen is not living in society, it is changing it.\u201d* - Augusto Boal SOURCES 1 https://design.cmu.edu/sites/default/files/Transition_Design_Monograph_final.pdf 2 https://donellameadows.org/dancing-with-systems/ 3 https://www.jonkolko.com/writingSensemaking.php","title":"Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20Engagement/#community-engagement","text":"During the past week we have been working with community engagement, understanding and learning about different tools to create local action-research projects with the goal of developing, testing, and implementing alternative and circular strategies towards a (more) locally productive and globally connected city.

What is intelligence? It can be defined in many ways, the capacity for abstraction, logic, understanding, self-awareness, learning, emotional knowledge, reasoning, planning, creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. More generally, it can be described as the ability to perceive information and retain it as knowledge to be applied towards adaptive behaviours within an environment or context. Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. The Oxford English Dictionary of Oxford University Press defines artificial intelligence as: \u2018the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.\u2019 AI applications include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision. In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analysing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction. Learning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task (1). We were introduced to different AI tools and how AI embodied in art can be a communicative way to understand how it works and what you can do with it. Estampa showed us how they work and different models that they\u2019ve developed and how we could use them. We used the \u2026 and analysed photos with the AI tool \u2026 that is trained to capture and illustrate what is represented in the photo. I analysed photos taken during the semester showing waste I had collected during a week and food waste found on the street, as well as scraps from vegetables. All things in the photos are things that we as humans regard as waste, yet the \u2018machine\u2019 did represent even one object in the photos as waste. It analysed the photos and communicated what it analysed exactly for what it is, materials and resources. Can this tool help people understand what they see to understand objects as resources instead of waste? It is a very interesting tool that we\u2019ll be using in the project I\u2019m working on together with a group of students on the subject food waste. DREAMCATCHER \u00b7 CRYSTAL FUTURES During these weeks we have worked on a project with AI embodied as a Christal Ball that acts as a dreamcatcher and future teller. It retrieves peoples dreams through scanning brain activity and translating it into images, encrypts them and analyses the network of all peoples collective dreams to create individual predictions of the future. It is embodied as a Chrystal ball that is owned personally and can be engaged with through text or voice recognition, where you can ask it questions about the future and it will predict individualised responses in the form of images. Although a speculative project, it might not be farfetched from what could be reality in the future. There are already apps and projects working with AI to analyse dreams and there meanings, as well as projects working with scanning brain activity through fMRI, which is a neural decoding approach in which machine-learning models predict the contents of visual imagery during the sleep-onset period, given measured brain activity, by discovering links between human functional magnetic resonance imaging patterns and verbal reports with the assistance of lexical and image databases (2). Other projects are researching and experimenting with methods to incubate dreams serving as tools for education for enhanced learning, creativity and memory for example. Media Lab\u2019s Fluid Interfaces group calls this method \u201cTargeted Dream Incubation\u201d (TDI). \u2018This protocol, implemented through an app in conjunction with a wearable sleep-tracking sensor device, not only helps record dream reports, but also guides dreams toward particular themes by repeating targeted information at sleep onset, thereby enabling incorporation of this information into dream content\u2019 (3). This research points to the possibility of these functions being a reality in the future, which calls for understanding the ethics in collecting and manipulating peoples dreams. Who will have access to this technology and information? If the collective dream dataset is hacked - what unethical uses could it be applied to? Could marketing technologies become even more powerful? If you can read the innermost fears and desires of a population, how well can you manipulate it?

It all started where we found that we had similar interests and started working togethere to find out more about this subject. During this term the channel has been food waste. Over 30% of food is lost or wasted each year. A striking number, given the large amount of hungry people in the world. Wasted food is not only inefficient, it\u2019s a social justice issue. Food is at the centre of people\u2019s needs linking everything and everyone. Food is fuel, it is energy, it shapes our identity, food connects people, food can bring comfort, confer status, and heal. We will always need food and it will therfor always be relevant. The subject of food is increasingly urgent across the globe. Food production contributes to more than 25% of global emissions. Each year around 70% of fresh water is used by agriculture, exhausting and contaminating water sources because of inefficient and excessive use. 42% food is wasted every year only by consumers. In a time of exploition, overconsumption, declines in insect populations, animal welfare, obesity etc we are working with the subject of food, food production, perceptions of food, and consumption. How can we change the perception we have of food and waste? How can we visualise and show the possibilities of the resources that it actually is? What are the wastestreams in the food supply chain and where can we interact Ways to improve food production is by reducing food waste, where reducing the amount of food waste reduces the amount of food that needs to be produced. 39% \u00b7 Production streams farmers, cultivators, factories, product packagers and trade intermediaries. crop losses, overproduction or odd sizes and looks are just a few examples. This means that these products don\u2019t even make it to the supermarkets and food service industries. 14% \u00b7 Restaurants of foodwaste overly large portions, strict food safety demands, inadequate stock acquisition or a lack of creativity to make use of decent products 42% \u00b7 Consumers too much food is bought, too much food is prepared in households, storing it incorrectly and wrong interpretation on expiry dates. // An experience to understand your direction through embodied action Cooking with food waste intervention within group Within a group of classmates interested in waste streams we have been exploring the topic of food waste. We organised a dinner together, where we saved foodwaste for 3 days which we then used to cook a dinner with together. It was a great experience where we learned new ways of using all parts of vegetables and rest products in other ways, things we would\u2019ve otherwise have thrown away. // An experience to understand your direction through embodied action // An experience to learn with and from others // An action to build trust FOOD NOT BOMBS 28.11.22 AGORA Juan Andres Benitez \u00b7 Food Not Bombs Dinner They pick up vegetables and food at Veritas that would otherwise be thrown away.

Or other shops that are not giving food away, that we can connect with other organisations so that all shops give away the food? There were 5(?) people working for FnB when we were there, they go to Agora Communal Garden and cook food with the vegetables they\u2019ve picked up that they then serve for free. The people that were in the community garden were mostly people that live in the neighbourhood and use the garden regularly. FnB wants to serve food to homeless, but food is not a very big problem for homeless in Bcn, its mostly shelter and care, and they will accept the food if its given to them but they don\u2019t come to the community garden. They also have the problem of not having containers to give away the rest of the food in // Can the community in the garden be a part of producing doggybags? they can bring the food home, or bring it to people in the neighbourhood that they know need it? // Could we connect the people that are using the garden to participate in the cooking process? Could FnB bring produce and they in the end cook together and for their own community and FnB can focus energy on other places and/or subjects? // Open source formpress to press doggybags from everyday materials/waste. Can be transferred to restaurants etc later // Connect FnB with other places where they can do the dinners, where they can connect to a bigger community? People who need it more?

Through exploring surrounding communities and contacts we\u2019ve been connecting with different restaurants and cafes to collect food waste. Collecting general food waste from the restaurant El doble in Born to experiment with how to use unsorted waste and what you can do with it. We have been collecting coffee grounds from the cafe Itnic in Poble Nou and eggshells from Brunch in Raval. These different waste streams have been collected to investigate and explore what these materials might be on a small scale and if they could be viable solutions for a better everyday life. What are the opportunities for materials to weave in ancestral knowledge, improve people-planet relationships, and enable a shift beyond human-centered design? Can we repair our local environments by designing with materials that are in symbiosis with the places we live? // A group activity tobring difficult topics to the table. From the interactions with the restuarant El Doble where waste has been collected to experiment with Bio Materials, we started discussing how to communicate the topic of food waste, how it can be reduced and how it can be used. This led to a collaboration with the restaurant where we had an event bringing up the topic through communicative and interactive posters and the resturant serving a special dish on the menu made only from the vegetable scraps that they would otherwise through away. The evening showed that many people were interested in the topic of waste, discussing the meaning of the word waste and how people perceive it became a great way to interact and learn from eachother. The dish that the restaurant made was beautifully served and presented helping to add value to what would otherwise be disgarded.","title":"Interventions"},{"location":"term1/10-Interventions/#interventions","text":"Throughout the term I have been working in a group together with four others about Hacking Supply Chains. It all started where we found that we had similar interests and started working togethere to find out more about this subject. During this term the channel has been food waste. Over 30% of food is lost or wasted each year. A striking number, given the large amount of hungry people in the world. Wasted food is not only inefficient, it\u2019s a social justice issue. Food is at the centre of people\u2019s needs linking everything and everyone. Food is fuel, it is energy, it shapes our identity, food connects people, food can bring comfort, confer status, and heal. We will always need food and it will therfor always be relevant.
