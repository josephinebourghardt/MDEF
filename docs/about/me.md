# **ABOUT**

Iâ€™m Josephine. I have a background in Product/ Furniture design where my focus lies in working with social and environmental issues and how the things around us affect people, mental health and the environment. 

I am an analytical problem-solver with a desire to understand how things fit together in a greater context where finding patterns and connections in complex situations and systems become possibilities for reforming and improving. With interests in research, psychology, well-being and function I seek to localise the core and essence of a problem or situation, working with solutions where the sum of parts, materials, space, objects and people come together as a whole.

My fight lies in creating a balance in the relationship between humans and nature and all that is in-between. Working with materials, production methods and communities to create regenerative environments.
