The first intervention for this term is a workshop planned together with Clean Beach Initiative and Centro de la Playa with the topic of Micro Plastics where we will be presenting the tools to collect micro Platsics that we worked on during the first term.

29.04.23 · Micro Plastic Workshop

This opportunity arose from the evolved collaboration and dialogues we have had with Clean Beach Initiative while participating in the beach cleanups they arrange on Saturdays. They have had contact with Centro de la Playa in the past but without continuation. To introduce the tools we have been working on to collect microplastics during the cleanup and to reconnect with Centro de la Playa we togehter organised a workshop where they will speak about how they work with the topic, we will show the tools and learnings we’ve had during the cleanups, therafter together use the tools while cleaning the beach and at the end have a dialogue about the outcomes and a brainstorming session to unlock topics and ideas that could contribute to cleaner beaches. 

This session will hopefully introduce our individual work and let us find possible collaborations within our mutual goals. 

Through the brainstorming session we are looking to ask how we can involve people on the beach to be more aware and active about keeping the beach clean, If there are possibilities for something permanent on the beach that could be used by organizations or general public? We will prepare the workshop with photos of other interventions around the world, as well as some topics in different scales to start conversations and the imagination.

The experience was very insightful. We listened to Marc from Centro de la Playa talk about Microplastics, origins and what can be done to prevent it from reaching nature. He also showed how Centro de la Playa works with educational programs for anyone that is interested. One of the things they teach and show in these programs is how to in a citizen science way, collect sand from different parts of the beach to document amounts of microplastics. 

It is done by randomly choosing a part of the beach, the top part of the sand in a square of 60 x 60 centimeters is collected in a bag, documented and registered exact space where collected and then brought back to the lab to seperate microplastics and sorted in size and origin to be documented. 

Sami and I then presented the work we've done during the beach cleanups, where we have brought different nets and tools to collect microplastics.

Therafter we had organised a brainstorming session to collectively reflect on what we had learned during the workshop and reflections about the beach cleanups, and different ways to approach solutions to waste, collection and

From the experience we had thought to look at ways of creating tools or possibilities for citizens and Clean Beach Initiative to use, although what became evidident was that first citizens need to become aware of the impact they can have by taking action. If participants of the group we were working with, that regularily go to beach cleanups were unaware of the amounts of microplastics in our environment and where they come from, we concluded that citizens outside of this community could also be unaware - of microplastics and waste on coastlines overall. 


During the beach cleanups we could see trends of where certain types of waste were normally found and collected. Micro plastics are mostly found in patches close to the meetup point and closer to the shoreline where the wind and sea havecollected them in patches. Cigarette butts are found all around the beach although it is now a nonsmoking beach, yet around the pathway there are large concentrations as well as all along the stroke in front of the beach clubs. Every Saturday during the beach clean ups there are large amounts of cigarette butts, lollipop sticks, plastic glasses and cans in this area. In frnt of the beach clubs along the shore there are during the day sunbeds, around these there are large amounts of cigarette butts as well.

Overall what is mostly found is cigarette butts, lollipop sticks, plastic and paper straws, cans, plsatic cups and bottles, plastic packaging, aluminium foil and packaging, paper cups and packaging, styrophoam, micro plstics, organic waste and fishing line and gear.

Clean Beach Initiative documents all the waste that is sorted and weighed at the end of each beach cleanup and posts the findings on their Instagram once a week. We volunteer every Saturday for one hour and know how much is collected, but how much did we collect in total? We started visualising how much waste this organisation and their volunteers collect every month and every year. Could it help to show the amount of waste collected in a very short amount of time in a visualisation to create awareness of the impact one hour a week can have?
