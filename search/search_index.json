Weak signals can be defined as the first indicator of a change or an emerging issue in the present that may become significant in the future. Investigating and discovering weak signals has been used in business settings to spot upcoming trends for investment. The Atlas of Weak Signals is a toolkit consisting of cards that recognise weak signals, random triggers and areas of opportunity into a practical space to navigate and understand possible emerging scenarios based on underlying trends in our current world. It facilitates seeking opportunities, threats, challenges and shared visions for innovation, policymaking, intervention, research and business opportunities in the future. The first exercise when using the AoWS toolkit was to randomly choose two weak signals, three random triggers and one area of opportunity and analyse what these mean, how they can be connected and what possible interventions could be. This what a great exercise to start understanding the methodology of how they can be used without directly choosing own areas of interest. Afterwards we looked through all the cards and chose one that was associated with our \u2018fight\u2019 posters and vision. Thereafter we walked around the city to take photos of interventions regarding the card we chose. I chose the card Regenerative Design as it is an overall concept of my vision and Fight poster. While walking around the city I passed through the SuperBlocks in Sant Antoni, one of the projects opening up spaces in the city where cars have been dominant. The projects Super Blocks address challenges such as mobility, public space, bio diversity and social cohesion, involving the participation of local residents and organisations. It is a low cost, small scale intervention that adds spaces of greenery for both humans and animals to coexist in urban environments. While continuing the journey through the city I walked passed a wall of graffiti paintings, where one of the art pieces cited \u2018Lo que era antes\u2019 - what has been - with a painting of a flower growing out of a tin can. What if what we produced could actually provide nurture to this flower growing, instead of overusing this flowers natural resources and spreading material that it can\u2019t use\u2026 PERSONAL DESIGN SPACE This toolkit is part of a method to help us communicate thoughts and concepts while supporting to detect a direction of our vision and areas of interest. When starting on my personal design space showing areas of interest and direction narrowing down the selection of cards to just a few was a challenge. I realised I have many interests, although when connecting them there is an overall theme. The Weak Signals chosen were Climate Conscience, Fight Anthropocene Conflicts, Inter-Species Collaboration and Human-Machine Creative Collaborations , where Regenerative Design was placed in the middle as a random trigger and binding theme. The random triggers around these Weak Signals can be divided into different sub categories. One evolves around working with material resources and production locally and reusability to design within planetary boundaries. This is prolonged into the area of collaborating with machines, questioning supply chains where open source innovation, personal fabrication and local production such as neighbourhood FabLabs could take part in the challenges of the first area. To extend these areas into practice the area of communicating and educating residents and users becomes one of the seeds and necessities for interventions in the other areas to start. How can we design within planetary boundaries on a local level? How can we create awareness and understanding of what citizens can do with the resources that are around them? I am looking forward to the upcoming weeks where we will be introduced to many different topics, as well as reflecting and engaging with topics in my neighbourhood and home that can be opportunities of interest. Some areas of interest that have arised while producing this Design Space are learning more about bio materials and synthetic biology, how it can be produced, used and reused. Using what already exists in nature to decrease waste and regenerate fuel for existing ecosystems. Other topics are about recycling waste and the recycling systems that exist in the area that I live, which I feel to be hard to understand and use. Many people I have spoken to in the neighbourhood are also unsure of the procedures and how it works. Can these be improved and communicated more clearly to decrease waste in the area? Another area of interest was sparked when taking photos of the Superblocks for this weeks assignment. The area in Sant Antoni where this block is, has created a space for people and other living things to co-exist with less cars, more plants and space. It is great for biodiversity to create these spaces, yet every night it is completely lit up by the street lights contributing to light pollution in urban environments. This disrupts ecosystems posing threat in particular to nocturnal wildlife, having negative impacts on plant and animal physiology. It can confuse the migratory patterns of animals, alter competitive interactions of animals and cause physiological harm. The rhythm of life is orchestrated by the natural diurnal patterns of light and dark; so disruption to these patterns impacts the ecological dynamics with just as big effect on humans, who are dependent on natural body cycles and the production of melatonin, which are regulated by light and dark. If humans are exposed to light while sleeping, melatonin production can be suppressed, which can lead to sleep disorders and other health problems such as fatigue, stress and increased anxiety among other things. This topic comes from a direct effect of my own sleep being disrupted from the overflow of artificial light. The subjects and signals in my Design Space are areas I want to learn more about. I am at the moment looking at these areas from a bigger perspective, being open to opportunities that are arising around me that can lead to an understanding of what areas to more specifically focus on.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"Josephine Bourghardt 16.10.22 During the second week of MDEF we were introduced to the Atlas of Weak Signals.

The prototype as an experimental component where prototyping tests a hypothesis. Through statistical analysis the prototypes test attributes such as: usability tests of the prototypes, experiential trials to assess the design attributes such as aesthetics, color, texture details, material properties or cases where the prototype is treated as a physical hypothesis. In product and furniture design rapid prototyping is a substantial part of the design process to test and understand form aesthetically and functionally, scale, construction and usability. Usually starting in a scale of 1:5 to quickly create and assess alternations in form and structure. Thereafter moving on to a rapid prototype in the scale of 1:1 to assess proportions aesthetically to the human body and space. It is a quick way to assess and test alternations that are thereafter tested in a functional 1:1 scale prototype testing ergonomics, usability and interaction, details and materials. The prototype as a means of inquiry where prototypes are developed and deployed as instruments of inquiry to collect, record and measure phenomena. Prototypes are in this case used as an open-ended exploration to find information where there is no hypothesis. It can be a qualitative and /or quantitive study that can be combined with other methods of finding information such as interviews. During projects this way of using prototypes can be a great way of understanding material properties by experimenting structural attributes, reformation and qualities. It is also a great way to understand how people behave or understand situations to learn new perspectives and understandings of a situation by using cultural or digital probes. The prototype as a research archetype as embodiments of concepts, understandings or design spaces that can be argued to constitute contributions to the discipline. The role the prototype plays in this contribution is usually exemplary and used to show different possibilities of how things could be. It illustrates or demonstrates possibilities as a physical embodiment of research concept,\u2019understanding or design research space. It is conceptual and methodological, where the result doesn\u2019t have to be a physical product, but can be a render, sketch or visualisation. The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry where the process of making an artefact becomes a qualitative instrumental tool in design research. The process is documented, analysed, critically assessed and written up, and the research contribution is tied not to the artefact itself but the process of prototyping and how it generates knowledge. It becomes a driver for the direction of research and can be seen in Co-Design and Participatory Design as well as Digital and Cultural Probes where people are brought into the design process. With this method of prototyping many different perspectives and understandings are brought into the process and become direction in where the project could be moving towards. The process becomes the important direction and by documenting and assessing the information that becomes visible along the way is can give more knowledge and insight than the actual result, if there is one. Throughout projects the different roles of prototyping provide information to help understand the situation and assess if it\u2019s moving in the right direction and solving the right problem. In many projects they intertwine and are used within different phases of the process to collect and assess information and I use most of them in most projects to find inspiration, understand context and users, as a means of experimenting and testing hypothesis. During this year I\u2019m looking to work more with prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry, to work participatory with communities and other fields of expertise.

DESIGN SPACE","title":"DESIGN STUDIO"},{"location":"term1/04-BioAgriZero/","text":"BIO AGRI ZERO \u00b6 This week we were introduced to the basics of biology, synthetic biology and bio materials. Biology can be seen as the study of life and can be studied very broadly focusing on the whole planet or in very specific studies of for example microscopic structures like bacteria or DNA. We got an introduction to microbiology, the study of microorganisms, a diverse group of generally minute simple life-forms that include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. The field is concerned with the structure, function, and classification of such organisms and with ways of both exploiting and controlling their activities. Thereafter we made our own DIY laboratory and created an All Purpose Medium with simple ingredients that can be found in the local supermarket to grow and analyse living matter. We went hunting for bacteria and chose to take samples from the bathroom door handle and different fingerprints. This was placed in the incubator to later observe and analyse if or what kind of bacteria grows. We learned the importance of labelling and sorting samples to know what is what and how it has been handled, taking notes on recipes, procedures, changes and time slots. We learned the procedure of using scientific methods to experiment to be able to communicate and analyse outcomes. We looked at different tissue and organs through microscopes to understand how different microscopes work. Learning about the possibilities of making your own DIY microscope. With other recipes in the DIY Lab we made different Bio Materials, again with simple ingredients that can be found in supermarkets. Our group worked with Glycerine, Maizena and Vinegar, resulting in a Bio \u2018Plastic\u2019 with slightly transparent property depending on the thickness chosen. With flexible characteristics the thinnest sample seems to suit this recipe the best. Thereafter we learned how to grow Combucha and Spirulina. In the Agri part we learned about bees and beekeeping and farm projects with the use of technology. Throughout the course we have been working with theory alongside practical work. Learning how to work with DIY Bioplastics, as well as growing Spirulina, was very inspiring and something I\u2019ll be working with more at home to investigate recipes and textures. I\u2019m also interested to learn more about the opensource beehives and how to communicate these projects. Analysis - Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops Published 29 September 2021 By Pallab Ghosh In the BBC article \u2018Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops you can read about how the UK discusses allowing gene edited fruits and vegetables to be commercially grown and available. Due to Brexit, the UK is no longer a part of the European Union and therefor neither the restrictions they have regarding gene modified or edited farming and produce. Many scientists believe that they can use gene editing to develop fruit, vegetables and cereals that are more nutritious and productive, as well as hardier varieties that can withstand the extremes of weather brought about by climate change, but this is restricted in many countries (Ghosh, 2021). As populations keep growing it is expected that food production will have to double in the next 50 years. Unintentional environmental factors effect crops where an average of 33% of all fruit and vegetables are wasted or lost to causes such as disease, drought, extremes of temperature, and other environmental stresses. Plant gene editing has a profound potential to create new crops with desirable characteristics that could improve agricultural production. Manipulation of plant genomes has been achieved with the gene-editing tool CRISPR\u2013Cas9. Mutations in the genomes can apply and activate valuable traits in many crop species, such as lifecycles, additional nutrition and growth. This may improve the overall efficiency of fruit and vegetable production so that costs may be lowered, thereby bringing fresh produce within the means of more populations and strengthening the industry as well as worldwide health (Shipman, et al, 2021) These possibilities of changing the traits of produce to increase nutrition and production can definitely help solve some of the issues from growing populations and environmental impacts in the future, but at what cost? The article continues with discussing the UK governments future thoughts of also reviewing regulations of all genetically modified organisms which includes allowing commercial development and farming of gene-edited and genetically modified animals. This can make them more productive, resistant to some diseases and better withstand weather conditions. Many scientists and others within the field are welcoming these changes, while there are groups that are sceptical to the ethical impacts it can have on production methods and safety of animals and other living organisms. In another BBC article - \u2018Rules to create gene-edited farm animals must put welfare first - review\u2019 a report by the Nuffield Council for Bioethics warns that removing the current ban on the commercial development of gene-edited animals could increase livestock suffering. As farming is a business there can be different understandings and thoughts from breeders of farm animals where to tread a line between what they can get out of it and animal welfare. If gene edited animals could better tolerate poor conditions without any apparent health impacts it causes tension between the producer and animal welfare. In an experiment carried out during the 1980s a human gene was added into the DNA of pigs expecting them to grow faster and become leaner. The experiment succeeded where the pigs weight gain increased, together with feed efficiency, and carcass fat reduced. In a commercial and productive point of view this experiment was successful, but beyond these effects the pigs also suffered from several unanticipated serious health problems and suffering. \u201cThose involved in policing must look beyond solely questions of food safety and keep in mind an overall vision of a food and farming system that supports sustainable farming and improves standards of animal welfare (Ghosh, 2021). Reading these articles about subjects that could soon become reality pose the questions of who and what will be next? Human genome editing has the potential to advance our ability to treat and cure disease with benefits including faster and more accurate diagnosis, more targeted treatments and prevention of genetic disorders. Somatic gene therapies, which involve modifying a patient\u2019s DNA to treat or cure a disease, have been successfully used to address HIV, sickle-cell disease and transthyretin amyloidosis. The technique could also vastly improve treatment for a variety of cancers (World Health Organisation, 2021). It could also be used to trans-generationally \u2018correct\u2019 or avoid single-gene disorders entirely, but like in other fields of genetics and genomics, such as newborn screening, reproductive genetics or return of results, it is not possible to globally agree on what is right and wrong as this can be influenced by various factors, such as commercial pressure, a technological imperative, ideological or political views, or personal values. As well as associated values often differing between different groups, different cultures and countries. As with any new experimental therapeutic, the unknowns still outweigh what is known and issues of risk assessment and safety, risk/benefit calculation, patient monitoring, reimbursement, equity in access to new therapies and the potential for the unjustified draining of resources from more pressing therapies, particular protection for vulnerable populations, and informed consent remain important to study further (Howard, et al. 2018). We live in an era of rapidly evolving technologies, where we previously, not a very long time ago, had more time to assess and adjust or correct impacts. As the world around keeps evolving in an even quicker pace, how can we assess how it is impacting the environment, what this is doing to our habits, the cultural sense of who we are, and even more have time to adjust or correct instabilities before the future impacts become unrepairable? From gene editing fruits and vegetables, to animals and then curing diseases in humans, what would be the next step? Is this therapy or enhancement? To be able to enhance traits that can benefit humans and the environment are great, but to what extent? Who would have access to these enhancements? And who decides this? The ethical questions about new technologies and methods are of great importance to discuss before taking action just because the possibilities are there. To assess what the actual impacts could be from different perspectives and within different systems is a crucial part of the process, one that in many situations has to be re introduced. These questions should be just a as important within all fields, one of them being design. Discussing and reflecting on what we are doing, why we are doing it and how it will impact the environment and living things around us, now and in the future. Sources Ghosh, Pallab.

Biology can be seen as the study of life and can be studied very broadly focusing on the whole planet or in very specific studies of for example microscopic structures like bacteria or DNA. We got an introduction to microbiology, the study of microorganisms, a diverse group of generally minute simple life-forms that include bacteria, archaea, algae, fungi, protozoa, and viruses. The field is concerned with the structure, function, and classification of such organisms and with ways of both exploiting and controlling their activities. Thereafter we made our own DIY laboratory and created an All Purpose Medium with simple ingredients that can be found in the local supermarket to grow and analyse living matter. We went hunting for bacteria and chose to take samples from the bathroom door handle and different fingerprints. This was placed in the incubator to later observe and analyse if or what kind of bacteria grows. We learned the importance of labelling and sorting samples to know what is what and how it has been handled, taking notes on recipes, procedures, changes and time slots. We learned the procedure of using scientific methods to experiment to be able to communicate and analyse outcomes. We looked at different tissue and organs through microscopes to understand how different microscopes work. Learning about the possibilities of making your own DIY microscope. With other recipes in the DIY Lab we made different Bio Materials, again with simple ingredients that can be found in supermarkets. Our group worked with Glycerine, Maizena and Vinegar, resulting in a Bio \u2018Plastic\u2019 with slightly transparent property depending on the thickness chosen. With flexible characteristics the thinnest sample seems to suit this recipe the best. Thereafter we learned how to grow Combucha and Spirulina. In the Agri part we learned about bees and beekeeping and farm projects with the use of technology. Throughout the course we have been working with theory alongside practical work. Learning how to work with DIY Bioplastics, as well as growing Spirulina, was very inspiring and something I\u2019ll be working with more at home to investigate recipes and textures. I\u2019m also interested to learn more about the opensource beehives and how to communicate these projects. Analysis - Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops Published 29 September 2021 By Pallab Ghosh In the BBC article \u2018Brexit paves the way for gene-edited crops you can read about how the UK discusses allowing gene edited fruits and vegetables to be commercially grown and available. Due to Brexit, the UK is no longer a part of the European Union and therefor neither the restrictions they have regarding gene modified or edited farming and produce. Many scientists believe that they can use gene editing to develop fruit, vegetables and cereals that are more nutritious and productive, as well as hardier varieties that can withstand the extremes of weather brought about by climate change, but this is restricted in many countries (Ghosh, 2021). As populations keep growing it is expected that food production will have to double in the next 50 years. Unintentional environmental factors effect crops where an average of 33% of all fruit and vegetables are wasted or lost to causes such as disease, drought, extremes of temperature, and other environmental stresses. Plant gene editing has a profound potential to create new crops with desirable characteristics that could improve agricultural production. Manipulation of plant genomes has been achieved with the gene-editing tool CRISPR\u2013Cas9. Mutations in the genomes can apply and activate valuable traits in many crop species, such as lifecycles, additional nutrition and growth. This may improve the overall efficiency of fruit and vegetable production so that costs may be lowered, thereby bringing fresh produce within the means of more populations and strengthening the industry as well as worldwide health (Shipman, et al, 2021) These possibilities of changing the traits of produce to increase nutrition and production can definitely help solve some of the issues from growing populations and environmental impacts in the future, but at what cost? The article continues with discussing the UK governments future thoughts of also reviewing regulations of all genetically modified organisms which includes allowing commercial development and farming of gene-edited and genetically modified animals. This can make them more productive, resistant to some diseases and better withstand weather conditions. Many scientists and others within the field are welcoming these changes, while there are groups that are sceptical to the ethical impacts it can have on production methods and safety of animals and other living organisms. In another BBC article - \u2018Rules to create gene-edited farm animals must put welfare first - review\u2019 a report by the Nuffield Council for Bioethics warns that removing the current ban on the commercial development of gene-edited animals could increase livestock suffering. As farming is a business there can be different understandings and thoughts from breeders of farm animals where to tread a line between what they can get out of it and animal welfare. If gene edited animals could better tolerate poor conditions without any apparent health impacts it causes tension between the producer and animal welfare. In an experiment carried out during the 1980s a human gene was added into the DNA of pigs expecting them to grow faster and become leaner. The experiment succeeded where the pigs weight gain increased, together with feed efficiency, and carcass fat reduced. In a commercial and productive point of view this experiment was successful, but beyond these effects the pigs also suffered from several unanticipated serious health problems and suffering. \u201cThose involved in policing must look beyond solely questions of food safety and keep in mind an overall vision of a food and farming system that supports sustainable farming and improves standards of animal welfare (Ghosh, 2021). Reading these articles about subjects that could soon become reality pose the questions of who and what will be next? Human genome editing has the potential to advance our ability to treat and cure disease with benefits including faster and more accurate diagnosis, more targeted treatments and prevention of genetic disorders. Somatic gene therapies, which involve modifying a patient\u2019s DNA to treat or cure a disease, have been successfully used to address HIV, sickle-cell disease and transthyretin amyloidosis. The technique could also vastly improve treatment for a variety of cancers (World Health Organisation, 2021). It could also be used to trans-generationally \u2018correct\u2019 or avoid single-gene disorders entirely, but like in other fields of genetics and genomics, such as newborn screening, reproductive genetics or return of results, it is not possible to globally agree on what is right and wrong as this can be influenced by various factors, such as commercial pressure, a technological imperative, ideological or political views, or personal values. As well as associated values often differing between different groups, different cultures and countries. As with any new experimental therapeutic, the unknowns still outweigh what is known and issues of risk assessment and safety, risk/benefit calculation, patient monitoring, reimbursement, equity in access to new therapies and the potential for the unjustified draining of resources from more pressing therapies, particular protection for vulnerable populations, and informed consent remain important to study further (Howard, et al. 2018). We live in an era of rapidly evolving technologies, where we previously, not a very long time ago, had more time to assess and adjust or correct impacts. As the world around keeps evolving in an even quicker pace, how can we assess how it is impacting the environment, what this is doing to our habits, the cultural sense of who we are, and even more have time to adjust or correct instabilities before the future impacts become unrepairable? From gene editing fruits and vegetables, to animals and then curing diseases in humans, what would be the next step? Is this therapy or enhancement? To be able to enhance traits that can benefit humans and the environment are great, but to what extent? Who would have access to these enhancements? And who decides this? The ethical questions about new technologies and methods are of great importance to discuss before taking action just because the possibilities are there. To assess what the actual impacts could be from different perspectives and within different systems is a crucial part of the process, one that in many situations has to be re introduced. These questions should be just a as important within all fields, one of them being design. Discussing and reflecting on what we are doing, why we are doing it and how it will impact the environment and living things around us, now and in the future. Sources Ghosh, Pallab.
